			<h1>The Last Psychiatrist: Alone</h1>
			<p>I learned about TLP from the brilliant <a href='https://eggreport.substack.com/'>randy</a>. His writing
				is very important, it changed me and it will probably change you as well. I am currently re-reading, I
				think I've read about 20-30 of his 700 blog posts. Yes I counted them (with bash), funny how it's
				exactly 700. His work is really something like world-building, the first few articles are hard to read,
				but when you start accepting his view of the world, it all comes together, and each article becomes a
				gestalt thing. It's a very satifsying process, you really get to become transformed into something
				better. His articles can be <a
					href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/10/the_plan_will_always_fail_cata.html">scary</a>, funny,
				and illuminating.
			<p>So here's what he has to say.</p>
			<h1>Narcissism</h1>
			<p> A person has to be defined by their actions. This is important to internalize, and clicked for me very
				quickly. Yes, each person has a lot more going on. You have everything that has happened to you, all of
				your complicated thoughts, your daydreams, etc etc. But everyone has to get judged, right? So we need a
				standard for evaluating people. The only one that really checks out is to only consider what someone
				<em>does</em>. This is also noted in the <a
					href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A16-20&version=NIV">bible</a>, so
				it's got to be true. Caring more about how you are percieved than what you do, and how that affects
				others is a fatal character flaw that everyone has developed. Do away with your neurotic issues of
				self-perception, and care more for how your actions affect those around you. That's all that matters.
			</p>
			<p> So, we are all narcissists. We are obsessed with our self-image. It is all we cherish. This is bad. The
				other hallmark of narcissism is shame.</p>
			<h1>Shame vs. Guilt</h1>
			<p>
			We (narcissists) feel shame all too easily. This is when we are made aware of the chasm between our mental
			image of ourself and how other people see us. Guilt is feeling bad because you did the wrong thing, you
			caused or didn't prevent harm to another. Shame is about yourself, guilt is about someone else. You
			- We all keep in the back of our heads the delectable fantasy that I am the only real person. Something like
			solipsism, but worse. I am the most rational and perceptive person in any room, everyone else matters only
			in relation to me. How much value they can provide to me, or damage they can cause to me. How much fun they
			can provide to me, how much they can validate me, how sharply they can insult me, how much status I can gain
			or lose from being seen with them. And all of this is nervously and heavily analyzed, arguably one of the
			most expensive processes your brain is running in a social environment.
			It requires a mature consciousness to realize that other people are actors independent of you, they have
			their own inner worlds which are probably just as rich as yours, and (statistically) you don't matter that
			much to them. They have their own entire life, family, and 100 other friends.
			</p>
			- Advertisements.
			- One of the more difficult pills to swallow. Advertising (by accident) assumed the role of defining social
			reality
			- Every ad is actually selling you something else behind your back.
			<quote>
				Commercials are even worse. That attractive, well dressed woman who looks longingly at a passing two
				door Acura ZDX is a synthesis that you resist-- you know that they're selling Acuras, and you're not
				falling for it. You're so clever, seeing through it-- you know owning an Acura doesn't make you an
				attractive well dressed woman, nor will it attract such a woman. But what you don't realize you're
				learning is that this is what attractive well dressed women look like. Acura is selling Macy's. And
				Macy's is having a sale; for the right price you can be 25 forever.

				That advertising agency probably just wanted to sell some cars today; not change the society you will
				want to participate in tomorrow.

			- Solution
			- Orient your self perception to your actions and how they affect others.
			<quote>
				Describe yourself: your traits, qualities, both good and bad.
				Do not use the word "am."
				Practice this.
			</quote>
			- Do something real.
			<quote>
				Do the opposite of what the narcissists did. They wanted to know enough to fake it. They read just
				enough to use the book to build an identity, so they read about books, but not the actual books.
			</quote>
			- Care about other people and do things that make their lives better. If this fails, pretend to care, and
			still do those things. The starving ethiopians don't care if you're building a well because you really want
			to or not, they just care that you're building a well.
