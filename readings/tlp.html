	<h1>The Last Psychiatrist: Alone</h1>
	<p>I learned about TLP from the brilliant <a href="https://eggreport.substack.com/">randy</a>. The author is anonymous, and goes by the moniker <em>Alone</em>. His work (a blog, and two books) is truly cutting. He presents a framework that paints a bleak picture of the modern landscape. </p>
	<!--
- Currently re-reading.
	- Scary (https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/10/the_plan_will_always_fail_cata.html)
	- Funny, always
	- Real connection between him and you. Brutal, but honest.
- A person has to be defined by their actions. Caring more about how you are percieved than what you do, and how that affects others is a fatal character flaw. bible quote
- We are all narcissists
	- Obsession with self image. 
	- Shame vs guilt. We (narcissists) feel shame all too easily. This is when we are made aware of the chasm between our mental image of ourself and how other people see us. Guilt is feeling bad because you did the wrong thing, you caused or didn't prevent harm to another. Shame is about yourself, guilt is about someone else.
	- We all keep in the back of our heads the delectable fantasy that I am the only real person. Something like solipsism, but worse. I am the most rational and perceptive person in any room, everyone else matters only in relation to me. How much value they can provide to me, or damage they can cause to me. How much fun they can provide to me, how much they can validate me, how sharply they can insult me, how much status I can gain or lose from being seen with them. And all of this is nervously and heavily analyzed, arguably one of the most expensive processes your brain is running in a social environment. 
	It requires a mature consciousness to realize that other people are actors independent of you, they have their own inner worlds which are probably just as rich as yours, and (statistically) you don't matter that much to them. They have their own entire life, family, and 100 other friends.
- Advertisements. 
	- One of the more difficult pills to swallow. Advertising (by accident) assumed the role of defining social reality
	- Every ad is actually selling you something else behind your back. 
	<quote>
Commercials are even worse.   That attractive, well dressed woman who looks longingly at a passing two door Acura ZDX is a synthesis that you resist-- you know that they're selling Acuras, and you're not falling for it.  You're so clever, seeing through it-- you know owning an Acura doesn't make you an attractive well dressed woman, nor will it attract such a woman.    But what you don't realize you're learning is that this is what attractive well dressed women look like.   Acura is selling Macy's.  And Macy's is having a sale; for the right price you can be 25 forever.

That advertising agency probably just wanted to sell some cars today; not change the society you will want to participate in tomorrow.

- Solution
	- Orient your self perception to your actions and how they affect others.
<quote>
Describe yourself: your traits, qualities, both good and bad.   
  
Do not use the word "am."   
  
Practice this.
</quote
	- Do something real. 
<quote>
Do the opposite of what the narcissists did.  They wanted to know enough to fake it.  They read just enough to use the book to build an identity, so they read about books, but not the actual books. 
</quote>
	- Care about other people and do things that make their lives better. If this fails, pretend to care, and still do those things. The starving ethiopians don't care if you're building a well because you really want to or not, they just care that you're building a well.
