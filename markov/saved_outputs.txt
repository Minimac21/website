distinguish them as pets or vivisect them or get out some fur or feathers 
rather painful interview 
fluttering tearful little woman of sentimental fiction running for comfort to male arms 
remote bells a voice that you should be saved 
fighting at any rate ransom let himself in a sort of ancient creatures it was foolish frightening ecstatic and unbearable all in favour of tasting this miracle again the wave to draw between eden and perelandra was at belbury and bracton 
man stared at her heels 
getting wet in a blitz wasnt he lovely
the plainest things are going to dissapear
no fears left for belbury
life seem so unimportant
we worship him because he died so soon
reasonable that you had been dead for several minutes praying that it hadnt happened
intimacy of that thirst kept him employed for what happened in malacandra and there was holiday in the order of probability
