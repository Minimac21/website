                        out of the silent planet




                                  one


the last drops of the thundershower had hardly ceased falling when the
pedestrian stuffed his map into his pocket  settled his pack more
comfortably on his tired shoulders  and stepped out from the shelter of a
large chestnut-tree into the middle of the road  a violent yellow sunset
was pouring through a rift in the clouds to westward  but straight ahead
over the hills the sky was the colour of dark slate  every tree and blade
of grass was dripping  and the road shone like a river  the pedestrian
wasted no time on the landscape but set out at once with the determined
stride of a good walker who has lately realized that he will have to walk
farther than he intended  that  indeed  was his situation  if he had
chosen to look back  which he did not  he could have seen the spire of
much nadderby  and  seeing it  might have uttered a malediction on the
inhospitable little hotel which  though obviously empty  had refused him
a bed  the place had changed hands since he last went for a walking-tour
in these parts  the kindly old landlord on whom he had reckoned had been
replaced by someone whom the barmaid referred to as the lady  and the
lady was apparently a british innkeeper of that orthodox school who
regard guests as a nuisance  his only chance now was sterk  on the far
side of the hills  and a good six miles away  the map marked an inn at
sterk  the pedestrian was too experienced to build any very sanguine
hopes on this  but there seemed nothing else within range 

he walked fairly fast  and doggedly  without looking much about him  like
a man trying to shorten the way with some interesting train of thought 
he was tall  but a little round-shouldered  about thirty-five to forty
years of age  and dressed with that particular kind of shabbiness which
marks a member of the intelligentsia on a holiday  he might easily have
been mistaken for a doctor or a schoolmaster at first sight  though he
had not the man-of-the-world air of the one or the indefinable breeziness
of the other  in fact  he was a philologist  and fellow of a cambridge
college  his name was ransom 

he had hoped when he left nadderby that he might find a nights lodging
at some friendly farm before he had walked as far as sterk  but the land
this side of the hills seemed almost uninhabited  it was a desolate 
featureless sort of country mainly devoted to cabbage and turnip  with
poor hedges and few trees  it attracted no visitors like the richer
country south of nadderby and it was protected by the hills from the
industrial areas beyond sterk  as the evening drew in and the noise of
the birds came to an end it grew more silent than an english landscape
usually is  the noise of his own feet on the metalled road became
irritating 

he had walked thus for a matter of two miles when he became aware of a
light ahead  he was close under the hills by now and it was nearly dark 
so that he still cherished hopes of a substantial farmhouse until he was
quite close to the real origin of the light  which proved to be a very
small cottage of ugly nineteenth-century brick  a woman darted out of the
open doorway as he approached it and almost collided with him 

i beg your pardon  sir  she said  i thought it was my harry 

ransom asked her if there was any place nearer than sterk where he might
possibly get a bed 

no  sir  said the woman  not nearer than sterk  i dare say as they
might fix you up at nadderby 

she spoke in a humbly fretful voice as if her mind were intent on
something else  ransom explained that he had already tried nadderby 

then i dont know  im sure  sir  she replied  there isnt hardly any
house before sterk  not what you want  theres only the rise  where my
harry works  and i thought you was coming from that way  sir  and thats
why i come out when i heard you  thinking it might be him  he ought to be
home this long time 

the rise  said ransom  whats that  a farm  would they put me up 

oh no  sir  you see theres no one there now except the professor and
the gentleman from london  not since miss alice died  they wouldnt do
anything like that  sir  they dont even keep any servants  except my
harry for doing the furnace like  and hes not in the house 

whats this professors name  asked ransom  with a faint hope 

i dont know  im sure  sir  said the woman  the other gentlemans mr 
devine  he is  and harry says the  other  gentleman is a professor  he
dont know much about it  you see  sir  being a little simple  and thats
why i dont like him coming home so late  and they said theyd always
send him home at six oclock  it isnt as if he didnt do a good days
work either 

the monotonous voice and the limited range of the womans vocabulary did
not express much emotion  but ransom was standing sufficiently near to
perceive that she was trembling and nearly crying  it occurred to him
that he ought to call on the mysterious professor and ask for the boy to
be sent home  and it occurred to him just a fraction of a second later
that once he were inside the house—among men of his own profession—he
might very reasonably accept the offer of a nights hospitality  whatever
the process of thought may have been  he found that the mental picture of
himself calling at the rise had assumed all the solidity of a thing
determined upon  he told the woman what he intended to do 

thank you very much  sir  im sure  she said  and if you would be so
kind as to see him out of the gate and on the road before you leave  if
you see what i mean  sir  hes that frightened of the professor and he
wouldnt come away once your back was turned  sir  not if they hadnt
sent him home themselves like 

ransom reassured the woman as well as he could and bade her good-bye 
after ascertaining that he would find the rise on his left in about five
minutes  stiffness had grown upon him while he was standing still  and he
proceeded slowly and painfully on his way 

there was no sign of any lights on the left of the road—nothing but the
flat fields and a mass of darkness which he took to be a copse  it seemed
more than five minutes before he reached it and found that he had been
mistaken  it was divided from the road by a good hedge and in the hedge
was a white gate  and the trees which rose above him as he examined the
gate were not the first line of a copse but only a belt  and the sky
showed through them  he felt quite sure now that this must be the gate of
the rise and that these trees surrounded a house and garden  he tried the
gate and found it locked  he stood for a moment undecided  discouraged by
the silence and the growing darkness  his first inclination  tired as he
felt  was to continue his journey to sterk  but he had committed himself
to a troublesome duty on behalf of the old woman  he knew that it would
be possible  if one really wanted  to force a way through the hedge  he
did not want to  a nice fool he would look  blundering in upon some
retired eccentric—the sort of a man who kept his gates locked in the
country—with this silly story of a hysterical mother in tears because her
idiot boy had been kept half an hour late at his work  yet it was
perfectly clear that he would have to get in  and since one cannot crawl
through a hedge with a pack on  he slipped his pack off and flung it over
the gate  the moment he had done so  it seemed to him that he had not
till now fully made up his mind—now that he must break into the garden if
only in order to recover the pack  he became very angry with the woman 
and with himself  but he got down on his hands and knees and began to
worm his way into the hedge 

the operation proved more difficult than he had expected and it was
several minutes before he stood up in the wet darkness on the inner side
of the hedge smarting from his contact with thorns and nettles  he groped
his way to the gate  picked up his pack  and then for the first time
turned to take stock of his surroundings  it was lighter on the drive
than it had been under the trees and he had no difficulty in making out a
large stone house divided from him by a width of untidy and neglected
lawn  the drive branched into two a little way ahead of him—the
right-hand path leading in a gentle sweep to the front door  while the
left ran straight ahead  doubtless to the back premises of the house  he
noticed that this path was churned up into deep ruts—now full of water—as
if it were used to carrying a traffic of heavy lorries  the other  on
which he now began to approach the house  was overgrown with moss  the
house itself showed no light  some of the windows were shuttered  some
gaped blank without shutter or curtain  but all were lifeless and
inhospitable  the only sign of occupation was a column of smoke that rose
from behind the house with a density which suggested the chimney of a
factory  or at least of a laundry  rather than that of a kitchen  the
rise was clearly the last place in the world where a stranger was likely
to be asked to stay the night  and ransom  who had already wasted some
time in exploring it  would certainly have turned away if he had not been
bound by his unfortunate promise to the old woman 

he mounted the three steps which led into the deep porch  rang the bell 
and waited  after a time he rang the bell again and sat down on a wooden
bench which ran along one side of the porch  he sat so long that though
the night was warm and starlit the sweat began to dry on his face and a
faint chilliness crept over his shoulders  he was very tired by now  and
it was perhaps this which prevented him from rising and ringing the third
time  this  and the soothing stillness of the garden  the beauty of the
summer sky  and the occasional hooting of an owl somewhere in the
neighbourhood which seemed only to emphasize the underlying tranquillity
of his surroundings  something like drowsiness had already descended upon
him when he found himself startled into vigilance  a peculiar noise was
going on—a scuffling  irregular noise  vaguely reminiscent of a football
scrum  he stood up  the noise was unmistakable by now  people in boots
were fighting or wrestling or playing some game  they were shouting too 
he could not make out the words but he heard the monosyllabic barking
ejaculations of men who are angry and out of breath  the last thing
ransom wanted was an adventure  but a conviction that he ought to
investigate the matter was already growing upon him when a much louder
cry rang out in which he could distinguish the words  let me go  let me
go  and then  a second later  im not going in there  let me go home 

throwing off his pack  ransom sprang down the steps of the porch  and ran
round to the back of the house as quickly as his stiff and footsore
condition allowed him  the ruts and pools of the muddy path led him to
what seemed to be a yard  but a yard surrounded with an unusual number of
outhouses  he had a momentary vision of a tall chimney  a low door filled
with red firelight  and a huge round shape that rose black against the
stars  which he took for the dome of a small observatory  then all this
was blotted out of his mind by the figures of three men who were
struggling together so close to him that he almost cannoned into them 
from the very first ransom felt no doubt that the central figure  whom
the two others seemed to be detaining in spite of his struggles  was the
old womans harry  he would like to have thundered out  what are you
doing to that boy  but the words that actually came—in rather an
unimpressive voice—were  here  i say       

the three combatants fell suddenly apart  the boy blubbering  may i
ask  said the thicker and taller of the two men  who the devil you may
be and what you are doing here  his voice had all the qualities which
ransoms had so regrettably lacked 

im on a walking-tour  said ransom  and i promised a poor woman——

poor woman be damned  said the other  how did you get in 

through the hedge  said ransom  who felt a little ill-temper coming to
his assistance  i dont know what youre doing to that boy  but——

we ought to have a dog in this place  said the thick man to his
companion  ignoring ransom 

you mean we should have a dog if you hadnt insisted on using tartar for
an experiment  said the man who had not yet spoken  he was nearly as
tall as the other  but slender  and apparently the younger of the two 
and his voice sounded vaguely familiar to ransom 

the latter made a fresh beginning  look here  he said  i dont know
what you are doing to that boy  but its long after hours and it is high
time you sent him home  i havent the least wish to interfere in your
private affairs  but——

who are you  bawled the thick man 

my name is ransom  if that is what you mean  and——

by jove  said the slender man  not ransom who used to be at
wedenshaw 

i was at school at wedenshaw  said ransom 

i thought i knew you as soon as you spoke  said the slender man  im
devine  dont you remember me 

of course  i should think i do  said ransom as the two men shook hands
with the rather laboured cordiality which is traditional in such
meetings  in actual fact ransom had disliked devine at school as much as
anyone he could remember 

touching  isnt it  said devine  the far-flung line even in the wilds
of sterk and nadderby  this is where we get a lump in our throats and
remember sunday-evening chapel in the d o p  you dont know weston 
perhaps  devine indicated his massive and loud-voiced companion   the 
weston  he added  you know  the great physicist  has einstein on toast
and drinks a pint of schrödingers blood for breakfast  weston  allow me
to introduce my old schoolfellow  ransom  dr  elwin ransom   the  ransom 
you know  the great philologist  has jespersen on toast and drinks a
pint——

i know nothing about it  said weston  who was still holding the
unfortunate harry by the collar  and if you expect me to say that i am
pleased to see this person who has just broken into my garden  you will
be disappointed  i dont care twopence what school he was at nor on what
unscientific foolery he is at present wasting money that ought to go to
research  i want to know what hes doing here  and after that i want to
see the last of him 

dont be an ass  weston  said devine in a more serious voice  his
dropping in is delightfully apropos  you mustnt mind westons little
way  ransom  conceals a generous heart beneath a grim exterior  you know 
youll come in and have a drink and something to eat of course 

thats very kind of you  said ransom  but about the boy——

devine drew ransom aside  balmy  he said in a low voice  works like a
beaver as a rule but gets these fits  we are only trying to get him into
the wash-house and keep him quiet for an hour or so till hes normal
again  cant let him go home in his present state  all done by kindness 
you can take him home yourself presently if you like—and come back and
sleep here 

ransom was very much perplexed  there was something about the whole scene
suspicious enough and disagreeable enough to convince him that he had
blundered on something criminal  while on the other hand he had all the
deep  irrational conviction of his age and class that such things could
never cross the path of an ordinary person except in fiction and could
least of all be associated with professors and old schoolfellows  even if
they had been ill-treating the boy  ransom did not see much chance of
getting him from them by force 

while these thoughts were passing through his head  devine had been
speaking to weston  in a low voice  but no lower than was to be expected
of a man discussing hospitable arrangements in the presence of a guest 
it ended with a grunt of assent from weston  ransom  to whose other
difficulties a merely social embarrassment was now being added  turned
with the idea of making some remark  but weston was now speaking to the
boy 

you have given enough trouble for one night  harry  he said  and in a
properly governed country id know how to deal with you  hold your tongue
and stop snivelling  you neednt go into the wash-house if you dont
want——

it werent the wash-house  sobbed the half-wit  you know it werent  i
dont want to go in  that  thing again 

he means the laboratory  interrupted devine  he got in there and was
shut in by accident for a few hours once  it put the wind up him for some
reason  lo  the poor indian  you know  he turned to the boy  listen 
harry  he said  this kind gentleman is going to take you home as soon
as hes had a rest  if youll come in and sit down quietly in the hall
ill give you something you like  he imitated the noise of a cork being
drawn from a bottle—ransom remembered it had been one of devines tricks
at school—and a guffaw of infantile knowingness broke from harrys lips 

bring him in  said weston as he turned away and disappeared into the
house  ransom hesitated to follow  but devine assured him that weston
would be very glad to see him  the lie was barefaced  but ransoms desire
for a rest and a drink were rapidly overcoming his social scruples 
preceded by devine and harry  he entered the house and found himself a
moment later seated in an arm-chair and awaiting the return of devine 
who had gone to fetch refreshments 




                                  two


the room into which he had been shown revealed a strange mixture of
luxury and squalor  the windows were shuttered and curtainless  the floor
was uncarpeted and strewn with packing-cases  shavings  newspapers and
boots  and the wall-paper showed the stains left by the pictures and
furniture of the previous occupants  on the other hand  the only two
arm-chairs were of the costliest type  and in the litter which covered
the tables  cigars  oyster-shells and empty champagne-bottles jostled
with tins of condensed milk and opened sardine-tins  with cheap crockery 
broken bread  and teacups a quarter full of tea and cigarette-ends 

his hosts seemed to be a long time away  and ransom fell to thinking of
devine  he felt for him that sort of distaste we feel for someone whom we
have admired in boyhood for a very brief period and then outgrown  devine
had learned just half a term earlier than anyone else that kind of humour
which consists in a perpetual parody of the sentimental or idealistic
clichés of ones elders  for a few weeks his references to the dear old
place and to playing the game  to the white mans burden and a straight
bat  had swept everyone  ransom included  off their feet  but before he
left wedenshaw ransom had already begun to find devine a bore  and at
cambridge he had avoided him  wondering from afar how anyone so flashy
and  as it were  ready-made  could be so successful  then had come the
mystery of devines election to the leicester fellowship  and the further
mystery of his increasing wealth  he had long since abandoned cambridge
for london  and was presumably something in the city  one heard of him
occasionally and ones informant usually ended either by saying  a damn
clever chap  devine  in his own way  or else by observing plaintively 
its a mystery to me how that man has got where he is  as far as ransom
could gather from their brief conversation in the yard  his old
schoolfellow had altered very little 

he was interrupted by the opening of the door  devine entered alone 
carrying a bottle of whiskey on a tray with glasses  and a syphon 

weston is looking out something to eat  he said as he placed the tray
on the floor beside ransoms chair  and addressed himself to opening the
bottle  ransom  who was very thirsty indeed by now  observed that his
host was one of those irritating people who forget to use their hands
when they begin talking  devine started to prise up the silver paper
which covered the cork with the point of a corkscrew  and then stopped to
ask 

how do you come to be in this benighted part of the country 

im on a walking-tour  said ransom  slept at stoke underwood last
night and had hoped to end at nadderby to-night  they wouldnt put me up 
so i was going on to sterk 

god  exclaimed devine  his corkscrew still idle  do you do it for
money  or is it sheer masochism 

pleasure  of course  said ransom  keeping his eye immovably on the
still unopened bottle 

can the attraction of it be explained to the uninitiate  asked devine 
remembering himself sufficiently to rip up a small portion of the silver
paper 

i hardly know  to begin with  i like the actual walking——

god  you must have enjoyed the army  jogging along to thingummy  eh 

no  no  its just the opposite of the army  the whole point about the
army is that you are never alone for a moment and can never choose where
youre going or even what part of the road youre walking on  on a
walking-tour you are absolutely detached  you stop where you like and go
on when you like  as long as it lasts you need consider no one and
consult no one but yourself 

until one night you find a wire waiting at your hotel saying  “come back
at once ” replied devine  at last removing the silver paper 

only if you were fool enough to leave a list of addresses and go to
them  the worst that could happen to me would be that man on the wireless
saying  “will dr  elwin ransom  believed to be walking somewhere in the
midlands——”

i begin to see the idea  said devine  pausing in the very act of
drawing the cork  it wouldnt do if you were in business  you are a
lucky devil  but can even you just disappear like that  no wife  no
young  no aged but honest parent or anything of that sort 

only a married sister in india  and then  you see  im a don  and a don
in the middle of long vacation is almost a non-existent creature  as you
ought to remember  college neither knows nor cares where he is  and
certainly no one else does 

the cork at last came out of the bottle with a heart-cheering noise 

say when  said devine  as ransom held out his glass  but i feel sure
theres a catch somewhere  do you really mean to say that no one knows
where you are or when you ought to get back  and no one can get hold of
you 

ransom was nodding in reply when devine  who had picked up the syphon 
suddenly swore  im afraid this is empty  he said  do you mind having
water  ill have to get some from the scullery  how much do you like 

fill it up  please  said ransom 

a few minutes later devine returned and handed ransom his long-delayed
drink  the latter remarked  as he put down the half-emptied tumbler with
a sigh of satisfaction  that devines choice of residence was at least as
odd as his own choice of a holiday 

quite  said devine  but if you knew weston youd realize that its
much less trouble to go where he wants than to argue the matter  what you
call a strong colleague 

colleague  said ransom inquiringly 

in a sense  devine glanced at the door  drew his chair closer to
ransoms  and continued in a more confidential tone  hes the goods all
right  though  between ourselves  i am putting a little money into some
experiments he has on hand  its all straight stuff—the march of progress
and the good of humanity and all that  but it has an industrial side 

while devine was speaking something odd began to happen to ransom  at
first it merely seemed to him that devines words were no longer making
sense  he appeared to be saying that he was industrial all down both
sides but could never get an experiment to fit him in london  then he
realized that devine was not so much unintelligible as inaudible  which
was not surprising  since he was now so far away—about a mile away 
though perfectly clear like something seen through the wrong end of a
telescope  from that bright distance where he sat in his tiny chair he
was gazing at ransom with a new expression on his face  the gaze became
disconcerting  ransom tried to move in his chair but found that he had
lost all power over his own body  he felt quite comfortable  but it was
as if his legs and arms had been bandaged to the chair and his head
gripped in a vice  a beautifully padded  but quite immovable  vice  he
did not feel afraid  though he knew that he ought to be afraid and soon
would be  then  very gradually  the room faded from his sight 

ransom could never be sure whether what followed had any bearing on the
events recorded in this book or whether it was merely an irresponsible
dream  it seemed to him that he and weston and devine were all standing
in a little garden surrounded by a wall  the garden was bright and
sunlit  but over the top of the wall you could see nothing but darkness 
they were trying to climb over the wall and weston asked them to give him
a hoist up  ransom kept on telling him not to go over the wall because it
was so dark on the other side  but weston insisted  and all three of them
set about doing so  ransom was the last  he got astride on the top of the
wall  sitting on his coat because of the broken bottles  the other two
had already dropped down on the outside into the darkness  but before he
followed them a door in the wall—which none of them had noticed—was
opened from without and the queerest people he had ever seen came into
the garden bringing weston and devine back with them  they left them in
the garden and retired into the darkness themselves  locking the door
behind them  ransom found it impossible to get down from the wall  he
remained sitting there  not frightened but rather uncomfortable because
his right leg  which was on the outside  felt so dark and his left leg
felt so light  my leg will drop off if it gets much darker  he said 
then he looked down into the darkness and asked  who are you  and the
queer people must still have been there for they all replied 
hoo—hoo—hoo  just like owls 

he began to realize that his leg was not so much dark as cold and stiff 
because he had been resting the other on it for so long  and also that he
was in an arm-chair in a lighted room  a conversation was going on near
him and had  he now realized  been going on for some time  his head was
comparatively clear  he realized that he had been drugged or hypnotized 
or both  and he felt that some control over his own body was returning to
him though he was still very weak  he listened intently without trying to
move 

im getting a little tired of this  weston  devine was saying  and
specially as its my money that is being risked  i tell you hell do
quite as well as the boy  and in some ways better  only  hell be coming
round very soon now and we must get him on board at once  we ought to
have done it an hour ago 

the boy was ideal  said weston sulkily  incapable of serving humanity
and only too likely to propagate idiocy  he was the sort of boy who in a
civilized community would be automatically handed over to a state
laboratory for experimental purposes 

i dare say  but in england he is the sort of boy in whom scotland yard
might conceivably feel an interest  this busybody  on the other hand 
will not be missed for months  and even then no one will know where he
was when he disappeared  he came alone  he left no address  he has no
family  and finally he has poked his nose into the whole affair of his
own accord 

well  i confess i dont like it  he is  after all  human  the boy was
really almost a—a preparation  still  hes only an individual  and
probably a quite useless one  were risking our own lives too  in a great
cause——

for the lords sake dont start all that stuff now  we havent time 

i dare say  replied weston  he would consent if he could be made to
understand 

take his feet and ill take his head  said devine 

if you really think hes coming round  said weston  youd better give
him another dose  we cant start till we get the sunlight  it wouldnt be
pleasant to have him struggling in there for three hours or so  it would
be better if he didnt wake up till we were under weigh 

true enough  just keep an eye on him while i run upstairs and get
another 

devine left the room  ransom saw through his half-closed eyes that weston
was standing over him  he had no means of foretelling how his own body
would respond  if it responded at all  to a sudden attempt of movement 
but he saw at once that he must take his chance  almost before devine had
closed the door he flung himself with all his force at westons feet  the
scientist fell forward across the chair  and ransom  flinging him off
with an agonizing effort  rose and dashed out into the hall  he was very
weak and fell as he entered it  but terror was behind him and in a couple
of seconds he had found the hall door and was working desperately to
master the bolts  darkness and his trembling hands were against him 
before he had drawn one bolt  booted feet were clattering over the
carpetless floor behind him  he was gripped by the shoulders and the
knees  kicking  writhing  dripping with sweat  and bellowing as loud as
he could in the faint hope of rescue  he prolonged the struggle with a
violence of which he would have believed himself incapable  for one
glorious moment the door was open  the fresh night air was in his face 
he saw the reassuring stars and even his own pack lying in the porch 
then a heavy blow fell on his head  consciousness faded  and the last
thing of which he was aware was the grip of strong hands pulling him back
into the dark passage  and the sound of a closing door 




                                 three


when ransom came to his senses he seemed to be in bed in a dark room  he
had a pretty severe headache  and this  combined with a general
lassitude  discouraged him at first from attempting to rise or to take
stock of his surroundings  he noticed  drawing his hand across his
forehead  that he was sweating freely  and this directed his attention to
the fact that the room  if it was a room  was remarkably warm  moving his
arms to fling off the bedclothes  he touched a wall at the right side of
the bed  it was not only warm  but hot  he moved his left hand to and fro
in the emptiness on the other side and noticed that there the air was
cooler—apparently the heat was coming from the wall  he felt his face and
found a bruise over the left eye  this recalled to his mind the struggle
with weston and devine  and he instantly concluded that they had put him
in an outhouse behind their furnace  at the same time he looked up and
recognized the source of the dim light in which  without noticing it  he
had all along been able to see the movements of his own hands  there was
some kind of skylight immediately over his head—a square of night sky
filled with stars  it seemed to ransom that he had never looked out on
such a frosty night  pulsing with brightness as with some unbearable pain
or pleasure  clustered in pathless and countless multitudes  dreamlike in
clarity  blazing in perfect blackness  the stars seized all his
attention  troubled him  excited him  and drew him up to a sitting
position  at the same time they quickened the throb of his headache  and
this reminded him that he had been drugged  he was just formulating to
himself the theory that the stuff they had given him might have some
effect on the pupil and that this would explain the unnatural splendour
and fullness of the sky  when a disturbance of silver light  almost a
pale and miniature sunrise  at one corner of the skylight  drew his eyes
upward again  some minutes later the orb of the full moon was pushing its
way into the field of vision  ransom sat still and watched  he had never
seen such a moon—so white  so blinding and so large  like a great
football just outside the glass  he thought  and then  a moment later 
no—its bigger than that  by this time he was quite certain that
something was seriously wrong with his eyes  no moon could possibly be
the size of the thing he was seeing 

the light of the huge moon—if it was a moon—had by now illuminated his
surroundings almost as clearly as if it were day  it was a very strange
room  the floor was so small that the bed and a table beside it occupied
the whole width of it  the ceiling seemed to be nearly twice as wide and
the walls sloped outward as they rose  so that ransom had the impression
of lying at the bottom of a deep and narrow wheelbarrow  this confirmed
his belief that his sight was either temporarily or permanently injured 
in other respects  however  he was recovering rapidly and even beginning
to feel an unnatural lightness of heart and a not disagreeable
excitement  the heat was still oppressive  and he stripped off everything
but his shirt and trousers before rising to explore  his rising was
disastrous and raised graver apprehensions in his mind about the effects
of being drugged  although he had been conscious of no unusual muscular
effort  he found himself leaping from the bed with an energy which
brought his head into sharp contact with the skylight and flung him down
again in a heap on the floor  he found himself on the other side against
the wall—the wall that ought to have sloped outwards like the side of a
wheelbarrow  according to his previous reconnaissance  but it didnt  he
felt it and looked at it  it was unmistakably at right angles to the
floor  more cautiously this time  he rose again to his feet  he felt an
extraordinary lightness of body  it was with difficulty that he kept his
feet on the floor  for the first time a suspicion that he might be dead
and already in the ghost-life crossed his mind  he was trembling  but a
hundred mental habits forbade him to consider this possibility  instead 
he explored his prison  the result was beyond doubt  all the walls looked
as if they sloped outwards so as to make the room wider at the ceiling
than it was at the floor  but each wall as you stood beside it turned out
to be perfectly perpendicular—not only to sight but to touch also if one
stooped down and examined with ones fingers the angle between it and the
floor  the same examination revealed two other curious facts  the room
was walled and floored with metal  and was in a state of continuous faint
vibration—a silent vibration with a strangely life-like and unmechanical
quality about it  but if the vibration was silent  there was plenty of
noise going on—a series of musical raps or percussions at quite irregular
intervals which seemed to come from the ceiling  it was as if the metal
chamber in which he found himself was being bombarded with small 
tinkling missiles  ransom was by now thoroughly frightened—not with the
prosaic fright that a man suffers in a war  but with a heady  bounding
kind of fear that was hardly distinguishable from his general excitement 
he was poised on a sort of emotional watershed from which  he felt  he
might at any moment pass either into delirious terror or into an ecstasy
of joy  he knew now that he was not in a house  but in some moving
vessel  it was clearly not a submarine  and the infinitesimal quivering
of the metal did not suggest the motion of any wheeled vehicle  a ship
then  he supposed  or some kind of airship       but there was an oddity
in all his sensations for which neither supposition accounted  puzzled 
he sat down again on the bed  and stared at the portentous moon 

an airship  some kind of flying-machine       but why did the moon look
so big  it was larger than he had thought at first  no moon could really
be that size  and he realized now that he had known this from the first
but had repressed the knowledge through terror  at the same moment a
thought came into his head which stopped his breath—there could be no
full moon at all that night  he remembered distinctly that he had walked
from nadderby in a moonless night  even if the thin crescent of a new
moon had escaped his notice  it could not have grown to this in a few
hours  it could not have grown to this at all—this megalomaniac disk  far
larger than the football he had at first compared it to  larger than a
childs hoop  filling almost half the sky  and where was the old man in
the moon—the familiar face that had looked down on all the generations
of men  the thing wasnt the moon at all  and he felt his hair move on
his scalp 

at that moment the sound of an opening door made him turn his head  an
oblong of dazzling light appeared behind him and instantly vanished as
the door closed again  having admitted the bulky form of a naked man whom
ransom recognized as weston  no reproach  no demand for an explanation 
rose to ransoms lips or even to his mind  not with that monstrous orb
above them  the mere presence of a human being  with its offer of at
least some companionship  broke down the tension in which his nerves had
long been resisting a bottomless dismay  he found  when he spoke  that he
was sobbing 

weston  weston  he gasped  what is it  its not the moon  not that
size  it cant be  can it 

no  replied weston  its the earth 




                                  four


ransoms legs failed him  and he must have sunk back upon the bed  but he
only became aware of this many minutes later  at the moment he was
unconscious of everything except his fear  he did not even know what he
was afraid of  the fear itself possessed his whole mind  a formless 
infinite misgiving  he did not lose consciousness  though he greatly
wished that he might do so  any change—death or sleep  or  best of all  a
waking which should show all this for a dream—would have been
inexpressibly welcome  none came  instead  the lifelong self-control of
social man  the virtues which are half hypocrisy or the hypocrisy which
is half a virtue  came back to him and soon he found himself answering
weston in a voice not shamefully tremulous 

do you mean that  he asked 

certainly 

then where are we 

standing out from earth about eighty-five thousand miles 

you mean were—in space  ransom uttered the word with difficulty as a
frightened child speaks of ghosts or a frightened man of cancer 

weston nodded 

what for  said ransom  and what on earth have you kidnapped me for 
and how have you done it 

for a moment weston seemed disposed to give no answer  then  as if on a
second thought  he sat down on the bed beside ransom and spoke as
follows 

i suppose it will save trouble if i deal with these questions at once 
instead of leaving you to pester us with them every hour for the next
month  as to how we do it—i suppose you mean how the space-ship
works—theres no good your asking that  unless you were one of the four
or five real physicists now living you couldnt understand  and if there
were any chance of your understanding you certainly wouldnt be told  if
it makes you happy to repeat words that dont mean anything—which is  in
fact  what unscientific people want when they ask for an explanation—you
may say we work by exploiting the less observed properties of solar
radiation  as to why we are here  we are on our way to malacandra       

do you mean a star called malacandra 

even you can hardly suppose we are going out of the solar system 
malacandra is much nearer than that  we shall make it in about
twenty-eight days 

there isnt a planet called malacandra  objected ransom 

i am giving it its real name  not the name invented by terrestrial
astronomers  said weston 

but surely this is nonsense  said ransom  how the deuce did you find
out its real name  as you call it 

from the inhabitants 

it took ransom some time to digest this statement  do you mean to tell
me you claim to have been to this star before  or this planet  or
whatever it is 

yes 

you cant really ask me to believe that  said ransom  damn it all 
its not an everyday affair  why has no one heard of it  why has it not
been in all the papers 

because we are not perfect idiots  said weston gruffly 

after a few moments silence ransom began again  which planet is it in
our terminology  he asked 

once and for all  said weston  i am not going to tell you  if you know
how to find out when we get there  you are welcome to do so  i dont
think we have much to fear from your scientific attainments  in the
meantime  there is no reason for you to know 

and you say this place is inhabited  said ransom 

weston gave him a peculiar look and then nodded  the uneasiness which
this produced in ransom rapidly merged in an anger which he had almost
lost sight of amidst the conflicting emotions that beset him 

and what has all this to do with me  he broke out  you have assaulted
me  drugged me  and are apparently carrying me off as a prisoner in this
infernal thing  what have i done to you  what do you say for yourself 

i might reply by asking you why you crept into my backyard like a thief 
if you had minded your own business you would not be here  as it is  i
admit that we have had to infringe your rights  my only defence is that
small claims must give way to great  as far as we know  we are doing what
has never been done in the history of man  perhaps never in the history
of the universe  we have learned how to jump off the speck of matter on
which our species began  infinity  and therefore perhaps eternity  is
being put into the hands of the human race  you cannot be so small-minded
as to think that the rights or the life of an individual or of a million
individuals are of the slightest importance in comparison with this 

i happen to disagree  said ransom  and i always have disagreed  even
about vivisection  but you havent answered my question  what do you want
me for  what good am i to do you on this—on malacandra 

that i dont know  said weston  it was no idea of ours  we are only
obeying orders 

whose 

there was another pause  come  said weston at last  there is really no
use in continuing this cross-examination  you keep on asking me questions
i cant answer  in some cases because i dont know the answers  in others
because you wouldnt understand them  it will make things very much
pleasanter during the voyage if you can only resign your mind to your
fate and stop bothering yourself and us  it would be easier if your
philosophy of life were not so insufferably narrow and individualistic  i
had thought no one could fail to be inspired by the role you are being
asked to play  that even a worm  if it could understand  would rise to
the sacrifice  i mean  of course  the sacrifice of time and liberty  and
some little risk  dont misunderstand me 

well  said ransom  you hold all the cards  and i must make the best of
it  i consider  your  philosophy of life raving lunacy  i suppose all
that stuff about infinity and eternity means that you think you are
justified in doing anything—absolutely anything—here and now  on the off
chance that some creatures or other descended from man as we know him may
crawl about a few centuries longer in some part of the universe 

yes—anything whatever  returned the scientist sternly  and all
educated opinion—for i do not call classics and history and such trash
education—is entirely on my side  i am glad you raised the point  and i
advise you to remember my answer  in the meantime  if you will follow me
into the next room  we will have breakfast  be careful how you get up 
your weight here is hardly appreciable compared with your weight on
earth 

ransom rose and his captor opened the door  instantly the room was
flooded with a dazzling golden light which completely eclipsed the pale
earthlight behind him 

i will give you darkened glasses in a moment  said weston as he
preceded him into the chamber whence the radiance was pouring  it seemed
to ransom that weston went up a hill towards the doorway and disappeared
suddenly downwards when he had passed it  when he followed—which he did
with caution—he had the curious impression that he was walking up to the
edge of a precipice  the new room beyond the doorway seemed to be built
on its side so that its farther wall lay almost in the same plane as the
floor of the room he was leaving  when  however  he ventured to put
forward his foot  he found that the floor continued flush and as he
entered the second room the walls suddenly righted themselves and the
rounded ceiling was over his head  looking back  he perceived that the
bedroom in its turn was now heeling over—its roof a wall and one of its
walls a roof 

you will soon get used to it  said weston  following his gaze  the
ship is roughly spherical  and now that we are outside the gravitational
field of the earth “down” means—and feels—towards the centre of our own
little metal world  this  of course  was foreseen and we built her
accordingly  the core of the ship is a hollow globe—we keep our stores
inside it—and the surface of that globe is the floor we are walking on 
the cabins are arranged all round this  their walls supporting an outer
globe which from our point of view is the roof  as the centre is always
“down ” the piece of floor you are standing on always feels flat or
horizontal and the wall you are standing against always seems vertical 
on the other hand  the globe of floor is so small that you can always see
over the edge of it—over what would be the horizon if you were a flea—and
then you see the floors and wall of the next cabin in a different plane 
it is just the same on earth  of course  only we are not big enough to
see it 

after this explanation he made arrangements in his precise  ungracious
way for the comfort of his guest or prisoner  ransom  at his advice 
removed all his clothes and substituted a little metal girdle hung with
enormous weights to reduce  as far as possible  the unmanageable
lightness of his body  he also assumed tinted glasses  and soon found
himself seated opposite weston at a small table laid for breakfast  he
was both hungry and thirsty and eagerly attacked the meal which consisted
of tinned meat  biscuit  butter and coffee 

but all these actions he had performed mechanically  stripping  eating
and drinking passed almost unnoticed  and all he ever remembered of his
first meal in the space-ship was the tyranny of heat and light  both were
present in a degree which would have been intolerable on earth  but each
had a new quality  the light was paler than any light of comparable
intensity that he had ever seen  it was not pure white but the palest of
all imaginable golds  and it cast shadows as sharp as a floodlight  the
heat  utterly free from moisture  seemed to knead and stroke the skin
like a gigantic masseur  it produced no tendency to drowsiness  rather 
intense alacrity  his headache was gone  he felt vigilant  courageous and
magnanimous as he had seldom felt on earth  gradually he dared to raise
his eyes to the skylight  steel shutters were drawn across all but a
chink of the glass  and that chink was covered with blinds of some heavy
and dark material  but still it was too bright to look at 

i always thought space was dark and cold  he remarked vaguely 

forgotten the sun  said weston contemptuously 

ransom went on eating for some time  then he began  if its like this in
the early morning  and stopped  warned by the expression on westons
face  awe fell upon him  there were no mornings here  no evenings  and no
night—nothing but the changeless noon which had filled for centuries
beyond history so many millions of cubic miles  he glanced at weston
again  but the latter held up his hand 

dont talk  he said  we have discussed all that is necessary  the ship
does not carry oxygen enough for any unnecessary exertion  not even for
talking 

shortly afterwards he rose  without inviting the other to follow him  and
left the room by one of the many doors which ransom had not yet seen
opened 




                                  five


the period spent in the space-ship ought to have been one of terror and
anxiety for ransom  he was separated by an astronomical distance from
every member of the human race except two whom he had excellent reasons
for distrusting  he was heading for an unknown destination  and was being
brought thither for a purpose which his captors steadily refused to
disclose  devine and weston relieved each other regularly in a room which
ransom was never allowed to enter and where he supposed the controls of
their machine must be  weston  during his watches off  was almost
entirely silent  devine was more loquacious and would often talk and
guffaw with the prisoner until weston rapped on the wall of the
control-room and warned them not to waste air  but devine was secretive
after a certain point  he was quite ready to laugh at westons solemn
scientific idealism  he didnt give a damn  he said  for the future of
the species or the meeting of two worlds 

theres more to malacandra than that  he would add with a wink  but
when ransom asked him what more  he would lapse into satire and make
ironical remarks about the white mans burden and the blessings of
civilization 

it  is  inhabited  then  ransom would press 

ah—theres always a native question in these things  devine would
answer  for the most part his conversation ran on the things he would do
when he got back to earth  ocean-going yachts  the most expensive women
and a big place on the riviera figured largely in his plans  im not
running all these risks for fun 

direct questions about ransoms own role were usually met with silence 
only once  in reply to such a question  devine  who was then in ransoms
opinion very far from sober  admitted that they were rather handing him
the baby 

but im sure  he added  youll live up to the old school tie 

all this  as i have said  was sufficiently disquieting  the odd thing was
that it did not very greatly disquiet him  it is hard for a man to brood
on the future when he is feeling so extremely well as ransom now felt 
there was an endless night on one side of the ship and an endless day on
the other  each was marvellous and he moved from the one to the other at
his will  delighted  in the nights  which he could create by turning the
handle of a door  he lay for hours in contemplation of the skylight  the
earths disk was nowhere to be seen  the stars  thick as daisies on an
uncut lawn  reigned perpetually with no cloud  no moon  no sunrise to
dispute their sway  there were planets of unbelievable majesty  and
constellations undreamed of  there were celestial sapphires  rubies 
emeralds and pin-pricks of burning gold  far out on the left of the
picture hung a comet  tiny and remote  and between all and behind all 
far more emphatic and palpable than it showed on earth  the
undimensioned  enigmatic blackness  the lights trembled  they seemed to
grow brighter as he looked  stretched naked on his bed  a second danaë 
he found it night by night more difficult to disbelieve in old astrology 
almost he felt  wholly he imagined  sweet influence pouring or even
stabbing into his surrendered body  all was silence but for the irregular
tinkling noises  he knew now that these were made by meteorites  small 
drifting particles of the world-stuff that smote continually on their
hollow drum of steel  and he guessed that at any moment they might meet
something large enough to make meteorites of ship and all  but he could
not fear  he now felt that weston had justly called him little-minded in
the moment of his first panic  the adventure was too high  its
circumstance too solemn  for any emotion save a severe delight  but the
days—that is  the hours spent in the sunward hemisphere of their
microcosm—were the best of all  often he rose after only a few hours
sleep to return  drawn by an irresistible attraction  to the regions of
light  he could not cease to wonder at the noon which always awaited you
however early you went to seek it  there  totally immersed in a bath of
pure ethereal colour and of unrelenting though unwounding brightness 
stretched his full length and with eyes half closed in the strange
chariot that bore them  faintly quivering  through depth after depth of
tranquillity far above the reach of night  he felt his body and mind
daily rubbed and scoured and filled with new vitality  weston  in one of
his brief  reluctant answers  admitted a scientific basis for these
sensations  they were receiving  he said  many rays that never penetrated
the terrestrial atmosphere 

but ransom  as time wore on  became aware of another and more spiritual
cause for his progressive lightening and exultation of heart  a
nightmare  long engendered in the modern mind by the mythology that
follows in the wake of science  was falling off him  he had read of
space  at the back of his thinking for years had lurked the dismal
fancy of the black  cold vacuity  the utter deadness  which was supposed
to separate the worlds  he had not known how much it affected him till
now—now that the very name space seemed a blasphemous libel for this
empyrean ocean of radiance in which they swam  he could not call it
dead  he felt life pouring into him from it every moment  how indeed
should it be otherwise  since out of this ocean the worlds and all their
life had come  he had thought it barren  he saw now that it was the womb
of worlds  whose blazing and innumerable offspring looked down nightly
even upon the earth with so many eyes—and here  with how many more  no 
space was the wrong name  older thinkers had been wiser when they named
it simply the heavens—the heavens which declared the glory—the

        happy climes that ly
  where day never shuts his eye
  up in the broad fields of the sky 

he quoted miltons words to himself lovingly  at this time and often 

he did not  of course  spend all his time in basking  he explored the
ship  so far as he was allowed   passing from room to room with those
slow movements which weston enjoined upon them lest exertion should
overtax their supply of air  from the necessity of its shape  the
space-ship contained a good many more chambers than were in regular use 
but ransom was also inclined to think that its owners—or at least
devine—intended these to be filled with cargo of some kind on the return
voyage  he also became  by an insensible process  the steward and cook of
the company  partly because he felt it natural to share the only labours
he could share—he was never allowed into the control-room—and partly in
order to anticipate a tendency which weston showed to make him a servant
whether he would or no  he preferred to work as a volunteer rather than
in admitted slavery  and he liked his own cooking a good deal more than
that of his companions 

it was these duties that made him at first the unwilling  and then the
alarmed  hearer of a conversation which occurred about a fortnight  he
judged  after the beginning of their voyage  he had washed up the remains
of their evening meal  basked in the sunlight  chatted with devine—better
company than weston  though in ransoms opinion much the more odious of
the two—and retired to bed at his usual time  he was a little restless 
and after an hour or so it occurred to him that he had forgotten one or
two small arrangements in the galley which would facilitate his work in
the morning  the galley opened off the saloon or day-room  and its door
was close to that of the control-room  he rose and went there at once 
his feet  like the rest of him  were bare 

the galley skylight was on the dark side of the ship  but ransom did not
turn on the light  to leave the door ajar was sufficient  as this
admitted a stream of brilliant sunlight  as everyone who has kept house
will understand  he found that his preparations for the morning had been
even more incomplete than he supposed  he did his work well  from
practice  and therefore quietly  he had just finished and was drying his
hands on the roller-towel behind the galley door when he heard the door
of the control-room open and saw the silhouette of a man outside the
galley—devines  he gathered  devine did not come forward into the
saloon  but remained standing and talking—apparently into the
control-room  it thus came about that while ransom could hear distinctly
what devine said  he could not make out westons answers 

i think it would be dam silly  said devine  if you could be sure of
meeting the brutes where we alight there might be something in it  but
suppose we have to trek  all wed gain by your plan would be having to
carry a drugged man and his pack instead of letting a live man walk with
us and do his share of the work 

weston apparently replied 

but he  cant  find out  returned devine  unless someone is fool
enough to tell him  anyway  even if he suspects  do you think a man like
that would have the guts to run away on a strange planet  without food 
without weapons  youll find hell eat out of your hand at the first
sight of a  sorn  

again ransom heard the indistinct noise of westons voice 

how should i know  said devine  it may be some sort of chief  much
more likely a mumbo-jumbo 

this time came a very short utterance from the control-room  apparently a
question  devine answered at once 

it would explain why he was wanted 

weston asked him something more 

human sacrifice  i suppose  at least it wouldnt be human from  their 
point of view  you know what i mean 

weston had a good deal to say this time  and it elicited devines
characteristic chuckle 

quite  quite  he said  it is understood that you are doing it all from
the highest motives  so long as they lead to the same actions as  my 
motives  you are quite welcome to them 

weston continued  and this time devine seemed to interrupt him 

youre not losing your own nerve  are you  he said  he was then silent
for some time  as if listening  finally  he replied 

if youre so fond of the brutes as that youd better stay and
interbreed—if they have sexes  which we dont yet know  dont you worry 
when the time comes for cleaning the place up well save one or two for
you  and you can keep them as pets or vivisect them or sleep with them or
all three—whichever way it takes you        yes  i know  perfectly
loathsome  i was only joking  good night 

a moment later devine closed the door of the control-room  crossed the
saloon and entered his own cabin  ransom heard him bolt the door of it
according to his invariable  though puzzling  custom  the tension with
which he had been listening relaxed  he found that he had been holding
his breath  and breathed deeply again  then cautiously he stepped out
into the saloon 

though he knew that it would be prudent to return to his bed as quickly
as possible  he found himself standing still in the now familiar glory of
the light and viewing it with a new and poignant emotion  out of this
heaven  these happy climes  they were presently to descend—into  what  
 sorns   human sacrifice  loathsome sexless monsters  what was a  sorn  
his own role in the affair was now clear enough  somebody or something
had sent for him  it could hardly be for him personally  the somebody
wanted a victim—any victim—from earth  he had been picked because devine
had done the picking  he realized for the first time—in all circumstances
a late and startling discovery—that devine had hated him all these years
as heartily as he hated devine  but what was a  sorn   when he saw them
he would eat out of devines hands  his mind  like so many minds of his
generation  was richly furnished with bogies  he had read his h  g  wells
and others  his universe was peopled with horrors such as ancient and
mediæval mythology could hardly rival  no insect-like  vermiculate or
crustacean abominable  no twitching feelers  rasping wings  slimy coils 
curling tentacles  no monstrous union of superhuman intelligence and
insatiable cruelty seemed to him anything but likely on an alien world 
the  sorns  would be       would be       he dared not think what the
 sorns  would be  and he was to be given to them  somehow this seemed
more horrible than being caught by them  given  handed over  offered  he
saw in imagination various incompatible monstrosities—bulbous eyes 
grinning jaws  horns  stings  mandibles  loathing of insects  loathing of
snakes  loathing of things that squashed and squelched  all played their
horrible symphonies over his nerves  but the reality would be worse  it
would be an extra-terrestrial otherness—something one had never thought
of  never could have thought of  in that moment ransom made a decision 
he could face death  but not the  sorns   he must escape when they got to
malacandra  if there were any possibility  starvation  or even to be
chased by  sorns   would be better than being handed over  if escape were
impossible  then it must be suicide  ransom was a pious man  he hoped he
would be forgiven  it was no more in his power  he thought  to decide
otherwise than to grow a new limb  without hesitation he stole back into
the galley and secured the sharpest knife  henceforward he determined
never to be parted from it 

such was the exhaustion produced by terror that when he regained his bed
he fell instantly into stupefied and dreamless sleep 




                                  six


he woke much refreshed  and even a little ashamed of his terror on the
previous night  his situation was  no doubt  very serious  indeed the
possibility of returning alive to earth must be almost discounted  but
death could be faced  and rational fear of death could be mastered  it
was only the irrational  the biological  horror of monsters that was the
real difficulty  and this he faced and came to terms with as well as he
could while he lay in the sunlight after breakfast  he had the feeling
that one sailing in the heavens  as he was doing  should not suffer
abject dismay before any earthbound creature  he even reflected that the
knife could pierce other flesh as well as his own  the bellicose mood was
a very rare one with ransom  like many men of his own age  he rather
underestimated than overestimated his own courage  the gap between
boyhoods dreams and his actual experience of the war had been startling 
and his subsequent view of his own unheroic qualities had perhaps swung
too far in the opposite direction  he had some anxiety lest the firmness
of his present mood should prove a short-lived illusion  but he must make
the best of it 

as hour followed hour and waking followed sleep in their eternal day  he
became aware of a gradual change  the temperature was slowly falling 
they resumed clothes  later  they added warm underclothes  later still 
an electric heater was turned on in the centre of the ship  and it became
certain  too—though the phenomenon was hard to seize—that the light was
less overwhelming than it had been at the beginning of the voyage  it
became certain to the comparing intellect  but it was difficult to  feel 
what was happening as a diminution of light and impossible to think of it
as darkening because  while the radiance changed in degree  its
unearthly quality had remained exactly the same since the moment he first
beheld it  it was not  like fading light upon the earth  mixed with the
increasing moisture and phantom colours of the air  you might halve its
intensity  ransom perceived  and the remaining half would still be what
the whole had been—merely less  not other  halve it again  and the
residue would still be the same  as long as it was at all  it would be
itself—out even to that unimagined distance where its last force was
spent  he tried to explain what he meant to devine 

like thingummys soap  grinned devine  pure soap to the last bubble 
eh 

shortly after this the even tenor of their life in the space-ship began
to be disturbed  weston explained that they would soon begin to feel the
gravitational pull of malacandra 

that means  he said  that it will no longer be “down” to the centre of
the ship  it will be “down” towards malacandra—which from our point of
view will be under the control-room  as a consequence  the floors of most
of the chambers will become wall or roof  and one of the walls a floor 
you wont like it 

the result of this announcement  so far as ransom was concerned  was
hours of heavy labour in which he worked shoulder to shoulder now with
devine and now with weston as their alternating watches liberated them
from the control-room  water-tins  oxygen-cylinders  guns  ammunition and
foodstuffs had all to be piled on the floors alongside the appropriate
walls and lying on their sides so as to be upright when the new
downwards came into play  long before the work was finished disturbing
sensations began  at first ransom supposed that it was the toil itself
which so weighted his limbs  but rest did not alleviate the symptom  and
it was explained to him that their bodies  in response to the planet that
had caught them in its field  were actually gaining weight every minute
and doubling in weight with every twenty-four hours  they had the
experiences of a pregnant woman  but magnified almost beyond endurance 

at the same time their sense of direction—never very confident on the
space-ship—became continuously confused  from any room on board  the next
rooms floor had always looked downhill and felt level  now it looked
downhill and felt a little  a very little  downhill as well  one found
oneself running as one entered it  a cushion flung aside on the floor of
the saloon would be found hours later to have moved an inch or so towards
the wall  all of them were afflicted with vomiting  headache and
palpitations of the heart  the conditions grew worse hour by hour  soon
one could only grope and crawl from cabin to cabin  all sense of
direction disappeared in a sickening confusion  parts of the ship were
definitely below in the sense that their floors were upside down and only
a fly could walk on them  but no part seemed to ransom to be indisputably
the right way up  sensations of intolerable height and of falling—utterly
absent in the heavens—recurred constantly  cooking  of course  had long
since been abandoned  food was snatched as best they could  and drinking
presented great difficulties  you could never be sure that you were
really holding your mouth below  rather than beside  the bottle  weston
grew grimmer and more silent than ever  devine  a flask of spirits ever
in his hand  flung out strange blasphemies and coprologies and cursed
weston for bringing them  ransom ached  licked his dry lips  nursed his
bruised limbs and prayed for the end 

a time came when one side of the sphere was unmistakably down  clamped
beds and tables hung useless and ridiculous on what was now wall or roof 
what had been doors became trap-doors  opened with difficulty  their
bodies seemed made of lead  there was no more work to be done when devine
had set out the clothes—their malacandrian clothes—from their bundles and
squatted down on the end wall of the saloon  now its floor  to watch the
thermometer  the clothes  ransom noticed  included heavy woollen
underwear  sheepskin jerkins  fur gloves and eared caps  devine made no
reply to his questions  he was engaged in studying the thermometer and in
shouting down to weston in the control-room 

slower  slower  he kept shouting  slower  you damned fool  youll be
in air in a minute or two  then sharply and angrily  here  let me get
at it 

weston made no replies  it was unlike devine to waste his advice  ransom
concluded that the man was almost out of his senses  whether with fear or
excitement 

suddenly the lights of the universe seemed to be turned down  as if some
demon had rubbed the heavens face with a dirty sponge  the splendour in
which they had lived for so long blenched to a pallid  cheerless and
pitiable grey  it was impossible from where they sat to open the shutters
or roll back the heavy blind  what had been a chariot gliding in the
fields of heaven became a dark steel box dimly lighted by a slit of
window  and falling  they were falling out of the heaven  into a world 
nothing in all his adventures bit so deeply into ransoms mind as this 
he wondered how he could ever have thought of planets  even of the earth 
as islands of life and reality floating in a deadly void  now  with a
certainty which never after deserted him  he saw the planets—the earths
he called them in his thought—as mere holes or gaps in the living
heaven—excluded and rejected wastes of heavy matter and murky air  formed
not by addition to  but by subtraction from  the surrounding brightness 
and yet  he thought  beyond the solar system the brightness ends  is that
the real void  the real death  unless       he groped for the idea      
unless visible light is also a hole or gap  a mere diminution of
something else  something that is to bright unchanging heaven as heaven
is to the dark  heavy earths       

things do not always happen as a man would expect  the moment of his
arrival in an unknown world found ransom wholly absorbed in a
philosophical speculation 




                                 seven


having a doze  said devine  a bit blasé about new planets by now 

can you see anything  interrupted weston 

i cant manage the shutters  damn them  returned devine  we may as
well get to the manhole 

ransom awoke from his brown study  the two partners were working together
close beside him in the semi-darkness  he was cold and his body  though
in fact much lighter than on earth  still felt intolerably heavy  but a
vivid sense of his situation returned to him  some fear  but more
curiosity  it might mean death  but what a scaffold  already cold air was
coming in from without  and light  he moved his head impatiently to catch
some glimpse between the labouring shoulders of the two men  a moment
later the last nut was unscrewed  he was looking out through the manhole 

naturally enough all he saw was the ground—a circle of pale pink  almost
of white  whether very close and short vegetation or very wrinkled and
granulated rock or soil he could not say  instantly the dark shape of
devine filled the aperture  and ransom had time to notice that he had a
revolver in his hand—for me or for  sorns  or for both  he wondered 

you next  said weston curtly 

ransom took a deep breath and his hand went to the knife beneath his
belt  then he got his head and shoulders through the manhole  his two
hands on the soil of malacandra  the pink stuff was soft and faintly
resilient  like india-rubber  clearly vegetation  instantly ransom looked
up  he saw a pale blue sky—a fine winter-morning sky it would have been
on earth—a great billowy cumular mass of rose-colour lower down which he
took for a cloud  and then—

get out  said weston from behind him 

he scrambled through and rose to his feet  the air was cold but not
bitterly so  and it seemed a little rough at the back of his throat  he
gazed about him  and the very intensity of his desire to take in the new
world at a glance defeated itself  he saw nothing but colours—colours
that refused to form themselves into things  moreover  he knew nothing
yet well enough to see it  you cannot see things till you know roughly
what they are  his first impression was of a bright  pale world—a
water-colour world out of a childs paint-box  a moment later he
recognized the flat belt of light blue as a sheet of water  or of
something like water  which came nearly to his feet  they were on the
shore of a lake or river 

now then  said weston  brushing past him  he turned and saw to his
surprise a quite recognizable object in the immediate foreground—a hut of
unmistakably terrestrial pattern though built of strange materials 

theyre human  he gasped  they build houses 

 we  do  said devine  guess again  and  producing a key from his
pocket  proceeded to unlock a very ordinary padlock on the door of the
hut  with a not very clearly defined feeling of disappointment or relief
ransom realized that his captors were merely returning to their own camp 
they behaved as one might have expected  they walked into the hut  let
down the slats which served for windows  sniffed the close air  expressed
surprise that they had left it so dirty  and presently re-emerged 

wed better see about the stores  said weston 

ransom soon found that he was to have little leisure for observation and
no opportunity of escape  the monotonous work of transferring food 
clothes  weapons and many unidentifiable packages from the ship to the
hut kept him vigorously occupied for the next hour or so  and in the
closest contact with his kidnappers  but something he learned  before
anything else he learned that malacandra was beautiful  and he even
reflected how odd it was that this possibility had never entered into his
speculations about it  the same peculiar twist of imagination which led
him to people the universe with monsters had somehow taught him to expect
nothing on a strange planet except rocky desolation or else a network of
nightmare machines  he could not say why  now that he came to think of
it  he also discovered that the blue water surrounded them on at least
three sides  his view in the fourth direction was blotted out by the vast
steel football in which they had come  the hut  in fact  was built either
on the point of a peninsula or on the end of an island  he also came
little by little to the conclusion that the water was not merely blue in
certain lights like terrestrial water but really blue  there was
something about its behaviour under the very gentle breeze which puzzled
him—something wrong or unnatural about the waves  for one thing  they
were too big for such a wind  but that was not the whole secret  they
reminded him somehow of the water that he had seen shooting up under the
impact of shells in pictures of naval battles  then suddenly realization
came to him  they were the wrong shape  out of drawing  far too high for
their length  too narrow at the base  too steep in the sides  he was
reminded of something he had read in one of those modern poets about a
sea rising in turreted walls 

catch  shouted devine  ransom caught and hurled the parcel on to weston
at the hut door 

on one side the water extended a long way—about a quarter of a mile  he
thought  but perspective was still difficult in the strange world  on the
other side it was much narrower  not wider than fifteen feet perhaps  and
seemed to be flowing over a shallow—broken and swirling water that made a
softer and more hissing sound than water on earth  and where it washed
the hither bank—the pinkish-white vegetation went down to the very
brink—there was a bubbling and sparkling which suggested effervescence 
he tried hard  in such stolen glances as the work allowed him  to make
out something of the farther shore  a mass of something purple  so huge
that he took it for a heather-covered mountain  was his first impression 
on the other side  beyond the larger water  there was something of the
same kind  but there  he could see over the top of it  beyond were
strange upright shapes of whitish green  too jagged and irregular for
buildings  too thin and steep for mountains  beyond and above these again
was the rose-coloured cloud-like mass  it might really be a cloud  but it
was very solid-looking and did not seem to have moved since he first set
eyes on it from the manhole  it looked like the top of a gigantic red
cauliflower—or like a huge bowl of red soapsuds—and it was exquisitely
beautiful in tint and shape 

baffled by this  he turned his attention to the nearer shore beyond the
shallows  the purple mass looked for a moment like a plump of
organ-pipes  then like a stack of rolls of cloth set up on end  then like
a forest of gigantic umbrellas blown inside out  it was in faint motion 
suddenly his eyes mastered the object  the purple stuff was vegetation 
more precisely it was vegetables  vegetables about twice the height of
english elms  but apparently soft and flimsy  the stalks—one could hardly
call them trunks—rose smooth and round  and surprisingly thin  for about
forty feet  above that  the huge plants opened into a sheaf-like
development  not of branches but of leaves  leaves large as lifeboats but
nearly transparent  the whole thing corresponded roughly to his idea of a
submarine forest  the plants  at once so large and so frail  seemed to
need water to support them  and he wondered that they could hang in the
air  lower down  between the stems  he saw the vivid purple twilight 
mottled with paler sunshine  which made up the internal scenery of the
wood 

time for lunch  said devine suddenly  ransom straightened his back  in
spite of the thinness and coldness of the air  his forehead was moist 
they had been working hard and he was short of breath  weston appeared
from the door of the hut and muttered something about finishing first 
devine  however  overruled him  a tin of beef and some biscuits were
produced  and the men sat down on the various boxes which were still
plentifully littered between the space-ship and the hut  some
whiskey—again at devines suggestion and against westons advice—was
poured into the tin cups and mixed with water  the latter  ransom
noticed  was drawn from their own water-tins and not from the blue lakes 

as often happens  the cessation of bodily activity drew ransoms
attention to the excitement under which he had been labouring ever since
their landing  eating seemed almost out of the question  mindful 
however  of a possible dash for liberty  he forced himself to eat very
much more than usual  and appetite returned as he ate  he devoured all
that he could lay hands on either of food or drink  and the taste of that
first meal was ever after associated in his mind with the first unearthly
strangeness  never fully recaptured  of the bright  still  sparkling 
unintelligible landscape—with needling shapes of pale green  thousands of
feet high  with sheets of dazzling blue soda-water  and acres of rose-red
soapsuds  he was a little afraid that his companions might notice  and
suspect  his new achievements as a trencherman  but their attention was
otherwise engaged  their eyes never ceased roving the landscape  they
spoke abstractedly and often changed position  and were ever looking over
their shoulders  ransom was just finishing his protracted meal when he
saw devine stiffen like a dog  and lay his hand in silence on westons
shoulder  both nodded  they rose  ransom  gulping down the last of his
whiskey  rose too  he found himself between his two captors  both
revolvers were out  they were edging him to the shore of the narrow
water  and they were looking and pointing across it 

at first he could not see clearly what they were pointing at  there
seemed to be some paler and slenderer plants than he had noticed before
amongst the purple ones  he hardly attended to them  for his eyes were
busy searching the ground—so obsessed was he with the reptile fears and
insect fears of modern imagining  it was the reflections of the new white
objects in the water that sent his eyes back to them  long  streaky 
white reflections motionless in the running water—four or five  no  to be
precise  six of them  he looked up  six white things  were  standing
there  spindly and flimsy things  twice or three times the height of a
man  his first idea was that they were images of men  the work of savage
artists  he had seen things like them in books of archæology  but what
could they be made of  and how could they stand —so crazily thin and
elongated in the leg  so top-heavily pouted in the chest  such stalky 
flexible-looking distortions of earthly bipeds       like something seen
in one of those comic mirrors  they were certainly not made of stone or
metal  for now they seemed to sway a little as he watched  now with a
shock that chased the blood from his cheeks he saw that they were alive 
that they were moving  that they were coming at him  he had a momentary 
scared glimpse of their faces  thin and unnaturally long  with long 
drooping noses and drooping mouths of half-spectral  half-idiotic
solemnity  then he turned wildly to fly and found himself gripped by
devine 

let me go  he cried 

dont be a fool  hissed devine  offering the muzzle of his pistol 
then  as they struggled  one of the things sent its voice across the
water to them  an enormous horn-like voice far above their heads 

they want us to go across  said weston 

both the men were forcing him to the waters edge  he planted his feet 
bent his back and resisted donkey-fashion  now the other two were both in
the water  pulling him  and he was still on the land  he found that he
was screaming  suddenly a second  much louder and less articulate noise
broke from the creatures on the far bank  weston shouted too  relaxed his
grip on ransom and suddenly fired his revolver not across the water but
up it  ransom saw why at the same moment 

a line of foam like the track of a torpedo was speeding towards them  and
in the midst of it some large  shining beast  devine shrieked a curse 
slipped and collapsed into the water  ransom saw a snapping jaw between
them  and heard the deafening noise of westons revolver again and again
beside him and  almost as loud  the clamour of the monsters on the far
bank  who seemed to be taking the water too  he had had no need to make a
decision  the moment he was free he had found himself automatically
darting behind his captors  then behind the space-ship and on as fast as
his legs could carry him into the utterly unknown beyond it  as he
rounded the metal sphere a wild confusion of blue  purple and red met his
eyes  he did not slacken his pace for a moments inspection  he found
himself splashing through water and crying out not with pain but with
surprise because the water was warm  in less than a minute he was
climbing out on to dry land again  he was running up a steep incline  and
now he was running through purple shadow between the stems of another
forest of the huge plants 




                                 eight


a month of inactivity  a heavy meal and an unknown world do not help a
man to run  half an hour later  ransom was walking  not running  through
the forest  with a hand pressed to his aching side and his ears strained
for any noise of pursuit  the clamour of revolver-shots and voices behind
him  not all human voices  had been succeeded first by rifle-shots and
calls at long intervals and then by utter silence  as far as eye could
reach he saw nothing but the stems of the great plants about him receding
in the violet shade  and far overhead the multiple transparency of huge
leaves filtering the sunshine to the solemn splendour of twilight in
which he walked  whenever he felt able he ran again  the ground continued
soft and springy  covered with the same resilient weed which was the
first thing his hands had touched in malacandra  once or twice a small
red creature scuttled across his path  but otherwise there seemed to be
no life stirring in the wood  nothing to fear—except the fact of
wandering unprovisioned and alone in a forest of unknown vegetation
thousands or millions of miles beyond the reach or knowledge of man 

but ransom was thinking of  sorns —for doubtless those were the  sorns  
those creatures they had tried to give him to  they were quite unlike the
horrors his imagination had conjured up  and for that reason had taken
him off his guard  they appealed away from the wellsian fantasies to an
earlier  almost an infantile  complex of fears 
giants—ogres—ghosts—skeletons  those were its key words  spooks on
stilts  he said to himself  surrealistic bogy-men with their long faces 
at the same time  the disabling panic of the first moments was ebbing
away from him  the idea of suicide was now far from his mind  instead  he
was determined to back his luck to the end  he prayed  and he felt his
knife  he felt a strange emotion of confidence and affection towards
himself—he checked himself on the point of saying  well stick to one
another 

the ground became worse and interrupted his meditation  he had been going
gently upwards for some hours with steeper ground on his right 
apparently half scaling  half skirting a hill  his path now began to
cross a number of ridges  spurs doubtless of the higher ground on the
right  he did not know why he should cross them  but for some reason he
did  possibly a vague memory of earthly geography suggested that the
lower ground would open out to bare places between wood and water where
 sorns  would be more likely to catch him  as he continued crossing
ridges and gullies he was struck with their extreme steepness  but
somehow they were not very difficult to cross  he noticed  too  that even
the smallest hummocks of earth were of an unearthly shape—too narrow  too
pointed at the top and too small at the base  he remembered that the
waves on the blue lakes had displayed a similar oddity  and glancing up
at the purple leaves he saw the same theme of perpendicularity—the same
rush to the sky—repeated there  they did not tip over at the ends  vast
as they were  air was sufficient to support them so that the long aisles
of the forest all rose to a kind of fan tracery  and the  sorns  
likewise—he shuddered as he thought it—they too were madly elongated 

he had sufficient science to guess that he must be on a world lighter
than the earth  where less strength was needed and nature was set free to
follow her skyward impulse on a superterrestrial scale  this set him
wondering where he was  he could not remember whether venus was larger or
smaller than earth  and he had an idea that she would be hotter than
this  perhaps he was on mars  perhaps even on the moon  the latter he at
first rejected on the ground that  if it were so  he ought to have seen
the earth in the sky when they landed  but later he remembered having
been told that one face of the moon was always turned away from the
earth  for all he knew he was wandering on the moons outer side  and 
irrationally enough  this idea brought about him a bleaker sense of
desolation than he had yet felt 

many of the gullies which he crossed now carried streams  blue hissing
streams  all hastening to the lower ground on his left  like the lake
they were warm  and the air was warm above them  so that as he climbed
down and up the sides of the gullies he was continually changing
temperatures  it was the contrast  as he crested the farther bank of one
such small ravine  which first drew his attention to the growing
chilliness of the forest  and as he looked about him he became certain
that the light was failing too  he had not taken night into his
calculations  he had no means of guessing what night might be on
malacandra  as he stood gazing into the deepening gloom a sigh of cold
wind crept through the purple stems and set them all swaying  revealing
once again the startling contrast between their size and their apparent
flexibility and lightness  hunger and weariness  long kept at bay by the
mingled fear and wonder of his situation  smote him suddenly  he shivered
and forced himself to proceed  the wind increased  the mighty leaves
danced and dipped above his head  admitting glimpses of a pale and then a
paler sky  and then  discomfortingly  of a sky with one or two stars in
it  the wood was no longer silent  his eyes darted hither and thither in
search of an approaching enemy and discovered only how quickly the
darkness grew upon him  he welcomed the streams now for their warmth 

it was this that first suggested to him a possible protection against the
increasing cold  there was really no use in going farther  for all he
knew he might as well be walking towards danger as away from it  all was
danger  he was no safer travelling than resting  beside some stream it
might be warm enough to lie  he shuffled on to find another gully  and
went so far that he began to think he had got out of the region of them 
he had almost determined to turn back when the ground began falling
steeply  he slipped  recovered and found himself on the bank of a
torrent  the trees—for as trees he could not help regarding them—did
not quite meet overhead  and the water itself seemed to have some faintly
phosphorescent quality  so that it was lighter here  the fall from right
to left was steep  guided by some vague picnickers hankering for a
better place  he went a few yards upstream  the valley grew steeper 
and he came to a little cataract  he noticed dully that the water seemed
to be descending a little too slowly for the incline  but he was too
tired to speculate about it  the water was apparently hotter than that of
the lake—perhaps nearer its subterranean source of heat  what he really
wanted to know was whether he dared drink it  he was very thirsty by now 
but it looked very poisonous  very unwatery  he would try not to drink
it  perhaps he was so tired that thirst would let him sleep  he sank on
his knees and bathed his hands in the warm torrent  then he rolled over
in a hollow close beside the fall  and yawned 

the sound of his own voice yawning—the old sound heard in
night-nurseries  school dormitories and in so many bedrooms—liberated a
flood of self-pity  he drew his knees up and hugged himself  he felt a
sort of physical  almost a filial  love for his own body  he put his
wrist-watch to his ear and found that it had stopped  he wound it 
muttering  half whimpering to himself  he thought of men going to bed on
the far-distant planet earth—men in clubs  and liners  and hotels 
married men  and small children who slept with nurses in the room  and
warm  tobacco-smelling men tumbled together in forecastles and dug-outs 
the tendency to talk to himself was irresistible       well look after
you  ransom       well stick together  old man  it occurred to him that
one of those creatures with snapping jaws might live in the stream 
youre quite right  ransom  he answered mumblingly  its not a safe
place to spend the night  well just rest a bit till you feel better 
then well go on again  not now  presently 




                                  nine


it was thirst that woke him  he had slept warm  though his clothes were
damp  and found himself lying in sunlight  the blue waterfall at his side
dancing and coruscating with every transparent shade in the whole gamut
of blue and flinging strange lights far up to the underside of the forest
leaves  the realization of his position  as it rolled heavily back upon
consciousness  was unbearable  if only he hadnt lost his nerve the
 sorns  would have killed him by now  then he remembered with
inexpressible relief that there was a man wandering in the wood—poor
devil—hed be glad to see him  he would come up to him and say  hullo 
ransom —he stopped  puzzled  no  it was only himself  he  was  ransom 
or was he  who was the man whom he had led to a hot stream and tucked up
in bed  telling him not to drink the strange water  obviously some
new-comer who didnt know the place as well as he  but whatever ransom
had told him  he was going to drink now  he lay down on the bank and
plunged his face in the warm rushing liquid  it was good to drink  it had
a strong mineral flavour  but it was very good  he drank again and found
himself greatly refreshed and steadied  all that about the other ransom
was nonsense  he was quite aware of the danger of madness  and applied
himself vigorously to his devotions and his toilet  not that madness
mattered much  perhaps he was mad already  and not really on malacandra
but safe in bed in an english asylum  if only it might be so  he would
ask ransom—curse it  there his mind went playing the same trick again  he
rose and began walking briskly away 

the delusions recurred every few minutes as long as this stage of his
journey lasted  he learned to stand still mentally  as it were  and let
them roll over his mind  it was no good bothering about them  when they
were gone you could resume sanity again  far more important was the
problem of food  he tried one of the trees with his knife  as he
expected  it was toughly soft like a vegetable  not hard like wood  he
cut a little piece out of it  and under this operation the whole gigantic
organism vibrated to its top—it was like being able to shake the mast of
a full-rigged ship with one hand  when he put it in his mouth he found it
almost tasteless but by no means disagreeable  and for some minutes he
munched away contentedly  but he made no progress  the stuff was quite
unswallowable and could only be used as a chewing-gum  as such he used
it  and after it many other pieces  not without some comfort 

it was impossible to continue yesterdays flight as a flight—inevitably
it degenerated into an endless ramble  vaguely motivated by the search
for food  the search was necessarily vague  since he did not know whether
malacandra held food for him nor how to recognize it if it did  he had
one bad fright in the course of the morning  when  passing through a
somewhat more open glade  he became aware first of a huge  yellow object 
then of two  and then of an indefinite multitude coming towards him 
before he could fly he found himself in the midst of a herd of enormous
pale furry creatures more like giraffes than anything else he could think
of  except that they could and did raise themselves on their hind legs
and even progress several paces in that position  they were slenderer 
and very much higher  than giraffes  and were eating the leaves off the
tops of the purple plants  they saw him and stared at him with their big
liquid eyes  snorting in  basso profondissimo   but had apparently no
hostile intentions  their appetite was voracious  in five minutes they
had mutilated the tops of a few hundred trees and admitted a new flood
of sunlight into the forest  then they passed on 

this episode had an infinitely comforting effect on ransom  the planet
was not  as he had begun to fear  lifeless except for  sorns   here was a
very presentable sort of animal  an animal which man could probably tame 
and whose food man could possibly share  if only it were possible to
climb the trees  he was staring about him with some idea of attempting
this feat  when he noticed that the devastation wrought by the
leaf-eating animals had opened a vista overhead beyond the plant-tops to
a collection of the same greenish-white objects which he had seen across
the lake at their first landing 

this time they were much closer  they were enormously high  so that he
had to throw back his head to see the top of them  they were something
like pylons in shape  but solid  irregular in height and grouped in an
apparently haphazard and disorderly fashion  some ended in points that
looked from where he stood as sharp as needles  while others  after
narrowing towards the summit  expanded again into knobs or platforms that
seemed to his terrestrial eyes ready to fall at any moment  he noticed
that the sides were rougher and more seamed with fissures than he had
realized at first  and between two of them he saw a motionless line of
twisting blue brightness—obviously a distant fall of water  it was this
which finally convinced him that the things  in spite of their improbable
shape  were mountains  and with that discovery the mere oddity of the
prospect was swallowed up in the fantastic sublime  here  he understood 
was the full statement of that  perpendicular  theme which beast and
plant and earth all played on malacandra—here in this riot of rock 
leaping and surging skyward like solid jets from some rock-fountain  and
hanging by their own lightness in the air  so shaped  so elongated  that
all terrestrial mountains must ever after seem to him to be mountains
lying on their sides  he felt a lift and lightening at the heart 

but next moment his heart stood still  against the pallid background of
the mountains and quite close to him—for the mountains themselves seemed
but a quarter of a mile away—a moving shape appeared  he recognized it
instantly as it moved slowly  and  he thought  stealthily  between two of
the denuded plant-tops—the giant stature  the cadaverous leanness  the
long  drooping  wizard-like profile of a  sorn   the head appeared to be
narrow and conical  the hands or paws with which it parted the stems
before it as it moved were thin  mobile  spidery and almost transparent 
he felt an immediate certainty that it was looking for him  all this he
took in in an infinitesimal time  the ineffaceable image was hardly
stamped on his brain before he was running as hard as he could into the
thickest of the forest 

he had no plan save to put as many miles as he could between himself and
the  sorn   he prayed fervently that there might be only one  perhaps the
wood was full of them—perhaps they had the intelligence to make a circle
round him  no matter—there was nothing for it now but sheer running 
running knife in hand  the fear had all gone into action  emotionally he
was cool and alert  and ready—as ready as he ever would be—for the last
trial  his flight led him downhill at an ever-increasing speed  soon the
incline was so steep that if his body had had terrestrial gravity he
would have been compelled to take to his hands and knees and clamber
down  then he saw something gleaming ahead of him  a minute later he had
emerged from the wood altogether  he was standing  blinking in the light
of sun and water  on the shore of a broad river  and looking out on a
flat landscape of intermingled river  lake  island and promontory—the
same sort of country on which his eyes had first rested in malacandra 

there was no sound of pursuit  ransom dropped down on his stomach and
drank  cursing a world where  cold  water appeared to be unobtainable 
then he lay still to listen and to recover his breath  his eyes were upon
the blue water  it was agitated  circles shuddered and bubbles danced ten
yards away from his face  suddenly the water heaved and a round  shining 
black thing like a cannonball came into sight  then he saw eyes and
mouth—a puffing mouth bearded with bubbles  more of the thing came up out
of the water  it was gleaming black  finally it splashed and wallowed to
the shore and rose  steaming  on its hind legs—six or seven feet high and
too thin for its height  like everything in malacandra  it had a coat of
thick black hair  lucid as seal-skin  very short legs with webbed feet  a
broad beaver-like or fish-like tail  strong fore-limbs with webbed claws
or fingers  and some complication half-way up the belly which ransom took
to be its genitals  it was something like a penguin  something like an
otter  something like a seal  the slenderness and flexibility of the body
suggested a giant stoat  the great round head  heavily whiskered  was
mainly responsible for the suggestion of seal  but it was higher in the
forehead than a seals and the mouth was smaller 

there comes a point at which the actions of fear and precaution are
purely conventional  no longer felt as terror or hope by the fugitive 
ransom lay perfectly still  pressing his body as well down into the weed
as he could  in obedience to a wholly theoretical idea that he might thus
pass unobserved  he felt little emotion  he noted in a dry  objective way
that this was apparently to be the end of his story—caught between a
 sorn  from the land and a big  black animal from the water  he had  it
is true  a vague notion that the jaws and mouth of the beast were not
those of a carnivore  but he knew that he was too ignorant of zoology to
do more than guess 

then something happened which completely altered his state of mind  the
creature  which was still steaming and shaking itself on the bank and had
obviously not seen him  opened its mouth and began to make noises  this
in itself was not remarkable  but a lifetime of linguistic study assured
ransom almost at once that these were articulate noises  the creature was
 talking   it had language  if you are not yourself a philologist  i am
afraid you must take on trust the prodigious emotional consequences of
this realization in ransoms mind  a new world he had already seen—but a
new  an extra-terrestrial  a non-human language was a different matter 
somehow he had not thought of this in connection with the  sorns   now 
it flashed upon him like a revelation  the love of knowledge is a kind of
madness  in the fraction of a second which it took ransom to decide that
the creature was really talking  and while he still knew that he might be
facing instant death  his imagination had leaped over every fear and hope
and probability of his situation to follow the dazzling project of making
a malacandrian grammar   an introduction to the malacandrian
language — the lunar verb — a concise martian-english dictionary       
the titles flitted through his mind  and what might one not discover from
the speech of a non-human race  the very form of language itself  the
principle behind all possible languages  might fall into his hands 
unconsciously he raised himself on his elbow and stared at the black
beast  it became silent  the huge bullet head swung round and lustrous
amber eyes fixed him  there was no wind on the lake or in the wood 
minute after minute in utter silence the representatives of two so
far-divided species stared each into the others face 

ransom rose to his knees  the creature leaped back  watching him
intently  and they became motionless again  then it came a pace nearer 
and ransom jumped up and retreated  but not far  curiosity held him  he
summoned up his courage and advanced holding out his hand  the beast
misunderstood the gesture  it backed into the shallows of the lake and he
could see the muscles tightened under its sleek pelt  ready for sudden
movement  but there it stopped  it  too  was in the grip of curiosity 
neither dared let the other approach  yet each repeatedly felt the
impulse to do so himself  and yielded to it  it was foolish  frightening 
ecstatic and unbearable all in one moment  it was more than curiosity  it
was like a courtship—like the meeting of the first man and the first
woman in the world  it was like something beyond that  so natural is the
contact of sexes  so limited the strangeness  so shallow the reticence 
so mild the repugnance to be overcome  compared with the first tingling
intercourse of two different  but rational  species 

the creature suddenly turned and began walking away  a disappointment
like despair smote ransom 

come back  he shouted in english  the thing turned  spread out its arms
and spoke again in its unintelligible language  then it resumed its
progress  it had not gone more than twenty yards away when ransom saw it
stoop down and pick something up  it returned  in its hand  he was
already thinking of its webbed fore-paw as a hand  it was carrying what
appeared to be a shell—the shell of some oyster-like creature  but
rounder and more deeply domed  it dipped the shell in the lake and raised
it full of water  then it held the shell to its own middle and seemed to
be pouring something into the water  ransom thought with disgust that it
was urinating in the shell  then he realized that the protuberances on
the creatures belly were not genital organs nor organs at all  it was
wearing a kind of girdle hung with various pouch-like objects  and it was
adding a few drops of liquid from one of these to the water in the shell 
this done it raised the shell to its black lips and drank—not throwing
back its head like a man but bowing it and sucking like a horse  when it
had finished it refilled the shell and once again added a few drops from
the receptacle—it seemed to be some kind of skin bottle—at its waist 
supporting the shell in its two arms  it extended them towards ransom 
the intention was unmistakable  hesitantly  almost shyly  he advanced and
took the cup  his finger-tips touched the webbed membrane of the
creatures paws and an indescribable thrill of mingled attraction and
repulsion ran through him  then he drank  whatever had been added to the
water was plainly alcoholic  he had never enjoyed a drink so much 

thank you  he said in english  thank you very much 

the creature struck itself on the chest and made a noise  ransom did not
first realize what it meant  then he saw that it was trying to teach him
its name—presumably the name of the species 

 hross  it said   hross  and flapped itself 

 hross   repeated ransom  and pointed at it  then man  and struck his
own chest 

 hmā—hmā—hmān   imitated the  hross   it picked up a handful of earth 
where earth appeared between weed and water at the bank of the lake 

 handra   it said  ransom repeated the word  then an idea occurred to
him 

 malacandra   he said in an inquiring voice  the  hross  rolled its
eyes and waved its arms  obviously in an effort to indicate the whole
landscape  ransom was getting on well   handra  was earth the element 
 malac-andra  the earth or planet as a whole  soon he would find out
what  malac  meant  in the meantime h disappears after c he noted  and
made his first step in malacandrian phonetics  the  hross  was now trying
to teach him the meaning of  handramit   he recognized the root  handra- 
again  and noted they have suffixes as well as prefixes   but this time
he could make nothing of the  hrosss  gestures  and remained ignorant
what a  handramit  might be  he took the initiative by opening his mouth 
pointing to it and going through the pantomime of eating  the
malacandrian word for  food  or  eat  which he got in return proved to
contain consonants unreproducible by a human mouth  and ransom 
continuing the pantomime  tried to explain that his interest was
practical as well as philological  the  hross  understood him  though he
took some time to understand from its gestures that it was inviting him
to follow it  in the end  he did so 

it took him only as far as where it had got the shell  and here  to his
not very reasonable astonishment  ransom found that a kind of boat was
moored  man-like  when he saw the artefact he felt more certain of the
 hrosss  rationality  he even valued the creature the more because the
boat  allowing for the usual malacandrian height and flimsiness  was
really very like an earthly boat  only later did he set himself the
question  what else could a boat be like  the  hross  produced an oval
platter of some tough but slightly flexible material  covered it with
strips of a spongy  orange-coloured substance and gave it to ransom  he
cut a convenient length off with his knife and began to eat  doubtfully
at first and then ravenously  it had a bean-like taste but sweeter  good
enough for a starving man  then  as his hunger ebbed  the sense of his
situation returned with dismaying force  the huge  seal-like creature
seated beside him became unbearably ominous  it seemed friendly  but it
was very big  very black  and he knew nothing at all about it  what were
its relations to the  sorns   and was it really as rational as it
appeared 

it was only many days later that ransom discovered how to deal with these
sudden losses of confidence  they arose when the rationality of the
 hross  tempted you to think of it as a man  then it became abominable—a
man seven feet high  with a snaky body  covered  face and all  with thick
black animal hair  and whiskered like a cat  but starting from the other
end you had an animal with everything an animal ought to have—glossy
coat  liquid eye  sweet breath and whitest teeth—and added to all these 
as though paradise had never been lost and earliest dreams were true  the
charm of speech and reason  nothing could be more disgusting than the one
impression  nothing more delightful than the other  it all depended on
the point of view 




                                  ten


when ransom had finished his meal and drunk again of the strong waters of
malacandra  his host rose and entered the boat  he did this head-first
like an animal  his sinuous body allowing him to rest his hands on the
bottom of the boat while his feet were still planted on the land  he
completed the operation by flinging rump  tail and hind legs all together
about five feet into the air and then whisking them neatly on board with
an agility which would have been quite impossible to an animal of his
bulk on earth 

having got into the boat  he proceeded to get out again and then pointed
to it  ransom understood that he was being invited to follow his example 
the question which he wanted to ask above all others could not  of
course  be put  were the  hrossa   he discovered later that this was the
plural of  hross   the dominant species on malacandra  and the  sorns  
despite their more man-like shape  merely a semi-intelligent kind of
cattle  fervently he hoped that it might be so  on the other hand  the
 hrossa  might be the domestic animals of the  sorns   in which case the
latter would be superintelligent  his whole imaginative training somehow
encouraged him to associate superhuman intelligence with monstrosity of
form and ruthlessness of will  to step on board the  hrosss  boat might
mean surrendering himself to  sorns  at the other end of the journey  on
the other hand  the  hrosss  invitation might be a golden opportunity of
leaving the  sorn -haunted forests for ever  and by this time the  hross 
itself was becoming puzzled at his apparent inability to understand it 
the urgency of its signs finally determined him  the thought of parting
from the  hross  could not be seriously entertained  its animality
shocked him in a dozen ways  but his longing to learn its language  and 
deeper still  the shy  ineluctable fascination of unlike for unlike  the
sense that the key to prodigious adventure was being put in his hands—all
this had really attached him to it by bonds stronger than he knew  he
stepped into the boat 

the boat was without seats  it had a very high prow  an enormous expanse
of free-board  and what seemed to ransom an impossibly shallow draught 
indeed  very little of it even rested on the water  he was reminded of a
modern european speed-boat  it was moored by something that looked at
first like rope  but the  hross  cast off not by untying but by simply
pulling the apparent rope in two as one might pull in two a piece of soft
toffee or a roll of plasticine  it then squatted down on its rump in the
stern-sheets and took up a paddle—a paddle of such enormous blade that
ransom wondered how the creature could wield it  till he again remembered
how light a planet they were on  the length of the  hrosss  body enabled
him to work freely in the squatting position despite the high gunwale  it
paddled quickly 

for the first few minutes they passed between banks wooded with the
purple trees  upon a waterway not more than a hundred yards in width 
then they doubled a promontory  and ransom saw that they were emerging on
to a much larger sheet of water—a great lake  almost a sea  the  hross  
now taking great care and often changing direction and looking about it 
paddled well out from the shore  the dazzling blue expanse grew moment by
moment wider around them  ransom could not look steadily at it  the
warmth from the water was oppressive  he removed his cap and jerkin  and
by so doing surprised the  hross  very much 

he rose cautiously to a standing position and surveyed the malacandrian
prospect which had opened on every side  before and behind them lay the
glittering lake  here studded with islands  and there smiling
uninterruptedly at the pale blue sky  the sun  he noticed  was almost
immediately overhead—they were in the malacandrian tropics  at each end
the lake vanished into more complicated groupings of land and water 
softly  featherily embossed in the purple giant weed  but this marshy
land or chain of archipelagoes  as he now beheld it  was bordered on each
side with jagged walls of the pale green mountains  which he could still
hardly call mountains  so tall they were  so gaunt  sharp  narrow and
seemingly unbalanced  on the starboard they were not more than a mile
away and seemed divided from the water only by a narrow strip of forest 
to the left they were far more distant  though still impressive—perhaps
seven miles from the boat  they ran on each side of the watered country
as far as he could see  both onwards and behind them  he was sailing  in
fact  on the flooded floor of a majestic canyon nearly ten miles wide and
of unknown length  behind and sometimes above the mountain peaks he could
make out in many places great billowy piles of the rose-red substance
which he had yesterday mistaken for cloud  the mountains  in fact  seemed
to have no fall of ground behind them  they were rather the serrated
bastion of immeasurable tablelands  higher in many places than
themselves  which made the malacandrian horizon left and right as far as
eye could reach  only straight ahead and straight astern was the planet
cut with the vast gorge  which now appeared to him only as a rut or crack
in the tableland 

he wondered what the cloud-like red masses were and endeavoured to ask by
signs  the question was  however  too particular for sign-language  the
 hross   with a wealth of gesticulation—its arms or fore-limbs were more
flexible than his and in quick motion almost whip-like—made it clear that
it supposed him to be asking about the high ground in general  it named
this  harandra   the low  watered country  the gorge or canyon  appeared
to be  handramit   ransom grasped the implications   handra  earth 
 harandra  high earth  mountain   handramit   low earth  valley  highland
and lowland  in fact  the peculiar importance of the distinction in
malacandrian geography he learned later 

by this time the  hross  had attained the end of its careful navigation 
they were a couple of miles from land when it suddenly ceased paddling
and sat tense with its paddle poised in the air  at the same moment the
boat quivered and shot forward as if from a catapult  they had apparently
availed themselves of some current  in a few seconds they were racing
forward at some fifteen miles an hour and rising and falling on the
strange  sharp  perpendicular waves of malacandra with a jerky motion
quite unlike that of the choppiest sea that ransom had ever met on earth 
it reminded him of disastrous experiences on a trotting horse in the
army  and it was intensely disagreeable  he gripped the gunwale with his
left hand and mopped his brow with his right—the damp warmth from the
water had become very troublesome  he wondered if the malacandrian food 
and still more the malacandrian drink  were really digestible by a human
stomach  thank heaven he was a good sailor  at least a fairly good
sailor  at least——

hastily he leaned over the side  heat from blue water smote up to his
face  in the depth he thought he saw eels playing  long  silver eels  the
worst happened not once but many times  in his misery he remembered
vividly the shame of being sick at a childrens party       long ago in
the star where he was born  he felt a similar shame now  it was not thus
that the first representative of humanity would choose to appear before a
new species  did  hrossa  vomit too  would it know what he was doing 
shaking and groaning  he turned back into the boat  the creature was
keeping an eye on him  but its face seemed to him expressionless  it was
only long after that he learned to read the malacandrian face 

the current meanwhile seemed to be gathering speed  in a huge curve they
swung across the lake to within a furlong of the farther shore  then back
again  and once more onward  in giddy spirals and figures of eight  while
purple wood and jagged mountain raced backwards and ransom loathingly
associated their sinuous course with the nauseous curling of the silver
eels  he was rapidly losing all interest in malacandra  the distinction
between earth and other planets seemed of no importance compared with the
awful distinction of earth and water  he wondered despairingly whether
the  hross  habitually lived on water  perhaps they were going to spend
the night in this detestable boat       

his sufferings did not  in fact  last long  there came a blessed
cessation of the choppy movement and a slackening of speed  and he saw
that the  hross  was backing water rapidly  they were still afloat  with
shores close on each side  between them a narrow channel in which the
water hissed furiously—apparently a shallow  the  hross  jumped
overboard  splashing abundance of warm water into the ship  ransom  more
cautiously and shakily  clambered after it  he was about up to his knees 
to his astonishment  the  hross   without any appearance of effort 
lifted the boat bodily on to the top of its head  steadied it with one
forepaw  and proceeded  erect as a grecian caryatid  to the land  they
walked forward—if the swinging movement of the  hrosss  short legs from
its flexible hips could be called walking—beside the channel  in a few
minutes ransom saw a new landscape 

the channel was not only a shallow but a rapid—the first  indeed  of a
series of rapids by which the water descended steeply for the next
half-mile  the ground fell away before them and the canyon—or
 handramit —continued at a very much lower level  its walls  however  did
not sink with it  and from his present position ransom got a clearer
notion of the lie of the land  far more of the highlands to left and
right were visible  sometimes covered with the cloud-like red swellings 
but more often level  pale and barren to where the smooth line of their
horizon marched with the sky  the mountain peaks now appeared only as the
fringe or border of the true highland  surrounding it as the lower teeth
surround the tongue  he was struck by the vivid contrast between
 harandra  and  handramit   like a rope of jewels the gorge spread
beneath him  purple  sapphire blue  yellow and pinkish white  a rich and
variegated inlay of wooded land and disappearing  reappearing  ubiquitous
water  malacandra was less like earth than he had been beginning to
suppose  the  handramit  was no true valley rising and falling with the
mountain chain it belonged to  indeed  it did not belong to a mountain
chain  it was only an enormous crack or ditch  of varying depth  running
through the high and level  harandra   the latter  he now began to
suspect  was the true surface of the planet—certainly would appear as
surface to a terrestrial astronomer  to the  handramit  itself there
seemed no end  uninterrupted and very nearly straight  it ran before him 
a narrowing line of colour  to where it clove the horizon with a v-shaped
indenture  there must be a hundred miles of it in view  he thought  and
he reckoned that he had put some thirty or forty miles of it behind him
since yesterday 

all this time they were descending beside the rapids to where the water
was level again and the  hross  could relaunch its skiff  during this
walk ransom learned the words for boat  rapid  water  sun and carry  the
latter  as his first verb  interested him particularly  the  hross  was
also at some pains to impress upon him an association or relation which
it tried to convey by repeating the contrasted pairs of words
 hrossa-handramit  and  séroni-harandra   ransom understood him to mean
that the  hrossa  lived down in the  handramit  and the  séroni  up on
the  harandra   what the deuce were  séroni   he wondered  the open
reaches of the  harandra  did not look as if anything lived up there 
perhaps the  hrossa  had a mythology—he took it for granted they were on
a low cultural level—and the  séroni  were gods or demons 

the journey continued  with frequent  though decreasing  recurrences of
nausea for ransom  hours later he realized that  séroni  might very well
be the plural of  sorn  

the sun declined  on their right  it dropped quicker than on earth  or at
least on those parts of earth that ransom knew  and in the cloudless sky
it had little sunset pomp about it  in some other queer way which he
could not specify it differed from the sun he knew  but even while he
speculated the needle-like mountain-tops stood out black against it and
the  handramit  grew dark  though eastward  to their left  the high
country of the  harandra  still shone pale rose  remote and smooth and
tranquil  like another and more spiritual world 

soon he became aware that they were landing again  that they were
treading solid ground  were making for the depth of the purple forest 
the motion of the boat still worked in his fantasy and the earth seemed
to sway beneath him  this  with weariness and twilight  made the rest of
the journey dream-like  light began to glare in his eyes  a fire was
burning  it illuminated the huge leaves overhead  and he saw stars beyond
them  dozens of  hrossa  seemed to have surrounded him  more animal  less
human  in their multitude and their close neighbourhood to him  than his
solitary guide had seemed  he felt some fear  but more a ghastly
inappropriateness  he wanted men—any men  even weston and devine  he was
too tired to do anything about these meaningless bullet heads and furry
faces—could make no response at all  and then  lower down  closer to him 
more mobile  came in throngs the whelps  the puppies  the cubs  whatever
you called them  suddenly his mood changed  they were jolly little
things  he laid his hand on one black head and smiled  the creature
scurried away 

he never could remember much of that evening  there was more eating and
drinking  there was continual coming and going of black forms  there were
strange eyes luminous in the firelight  finally  there was sleep in some
dark  apparently covered place 




                                 eleven


ever since he awoke on the space-ship ransom had been thinking about the
amazing adventure of going to another planet  and about his chances of
returning from it  what he had not thought about was  being  on it  it
was with a kind of stupefaction each morning that he found himself
neither arriving in  nor escaping from  but simply living on  malacandra 
waking  sleeping  eating  swimming and even  as the days passed  talking 
the wonder of it smote him most strongly when he found himself  about
three weeks after his arrival  actually going for a walk  a few weeks
later he had his favourite walks  and his favourite foods  he was
beginning to develop habits  he knew a male from a female  hross  at
sight  and even individual differences were becoming plain  hyoi who had
first found him—miles away to the north—was a very different person from
the grey-muzzled  venerable hnohra who was daily teaching him the
language  and the young of the species were different again  they were
delightful  you could forget all about the rationality of  hrossa  in
dealing with them  too young to trouble him with the baffling enigma of
reason in an inhuman form  they solaced his loneliness  as if he had been
allowed to bring a few dogs with him from the earth  the cubs  on their
part  felt the liveliest interest in the hairless goblin which had
appeared among them  with them  and therefore indirectly with their dams 
he was a brilliant success 

of the community in general his earlier impressions were all gradually
being corrected  his first diagnosis of their culture was what he called
old stone age  the few cutting instruments they possessed were made of
stone  they seemed to have no pottery but a few clumsy vessels used for
boiling  and boiling was the only cookery they attempted  their common
drinking vessel  dish and ladle all in one was the oyster-like shell in
which he had first tasted  hross  hospitality  the fish which it
contained was their only animal food  vegetable fare they had in great
plenty and variety  some of it delicious  even the pinkish-white weed
which covered the whole  handramit  was edible at a pinch  so that if he
had starved before hyoi found him he would have starved amidst abundance 
no  hross   however  ate the weed   honodraskrud   for choice  though it
might be used  faute de mieux  on a journey  their dwellings were
beehive-shaped huts of stiff leaf and the villages—there were several in
the neighbourhood—were always built beside rivers for warmth and well
upstream towards the walls of the  handramit  where the water was
hottest  they slept on the ground  they seemed to have no arts except a
kind of poetry and music which was practised almost every evening by a
team or troupe of four  hrossa   one recited half chanting at great
length while the other three  sometimes singly and sometimes
antiphonally  interrupted him from time to time with song  ransom could
not find out whether these interruptions were simply lyrical interludes
or dramatic dialogue arising out of the leaders narrative  he could make
nothing of the music  the voices were not disagreeable and the scale
seemed adapted to human ears  but the time-pattern was meaningless to his
sense of rhythm  the occupations of the tribe or family were at first
mysterious  people were always disappearing for a few days and
reappearing again  there was a little fishing and much journeying in
boats of which he never discovered the object  then one day he saw a kind
of caravan of  hrossa  setting out by land each with a load of vegetable
food on its head  apparently there was some kind of trade in malacandra 

he discovered their agriculture in the first week  about a mile down the
 handramit  one came to broad lands free of forest and clothed for many
miles together in low pulpy vegetation in which yellow  orange and blue
predominated  later on  there were lettuce-like plants about the height
of a terrestrial birch-tree  where one of these overhung the warmth of
water you could step into one of the lower leaves and lie deliciously as
in a gently moving  fragrant hammock  elsewhere it was not warm enough to
sit still for long out of doors  the general temperature of the
 handramit  was that of a fine winters morning on earth  these
food-producing areas were worked communally by the surrounding villages 
and division of labour had been carried to a higher point than he
expected  cutting  drying  storing  transport and something like manuring
were all carried on  and he suspected that some at least of the water
channels were artificial 

but the real revolution in his understanding of the  hrossa  began when
he had learned enough of their language to attempt some satisfaction of
their curiosity about himself  in answer to their questions he began by
saying that he had come out of the sky  hnohra immediately asked from
which planet or earth   handra    ransom  who had deliberately given a
childish version of the truth in order to adapt it to the supposed
ignorance of his audience  was a little annoyed to find hnohra painfully
explaining to him that he could not live in the sky because there was no
air in it  he might have come through the sky but he must have come from
a  handra   he was quite unable to point earth out to them in the night
sky  they seemed surprised at his inability  and repeatedly pointed out
to him a bright planet low on the western horizon—a little south of where
the sun had gone down  he was surprised that they selected a planet
instead of a mere star and stuck to their choice  could it be possible
that they understood astronomy  unfortunately he still knew too little of
the language to explore their knowledge  he turned the conversation by
asking them the name of the bright southern planet  and was told that it
was thulcandra—the silent world or planet 

why do you call it  thulc   he asked  why silent  no one knew 

the  séroni  know  said hnohra  that is the sort of thing they know 

then he was asked how he had come  and made a very poor attempt at
describing the space-ship—but again 

the  séroni  would know 

had he come alone  no  he had come with two others of his kind—bad men
 bent men was the nearest  hrossian  equivalent  who tried to kill him 
but he had run away from them  the  hrossa  found this very difficult 
but all finally agreed that he ought to go to oyarsa  oyarsa would
protect him  ransom asked who oyarsa was  slowly  and with many
misunderstandings  he hammered out the information that oyarsa  1  lived
at meldilorn   2  knew everything and ruled everyone   3  had always been
there  and  4  was not a  hross   nor one of the  séroni   then ransom 
following his own idea  asked if oyarsa had made the world  the  hrossa 
almost barked in the fervour of their denial  did people in thulcandra
not know that maleldil the young had made and still ruled the world  even
a child knew that  where did maleldil live  ransom asked 

with the old one 

and who was the old one  ransom did not understand the answer  he tried
again 

where was the old one 

he is not that sort  said hnohra  that he has to live anywhere  and
proceeded to a good deal which ransom did not follow  but he followed
enough to feel once more a certain irritation  ever since he had
discovered the rationality of the  hrossa  he had been haunted by a
conscientious scruple as to whether it might not be his duty to undertake
their religious instruction  now  as a result of his tentative efforts 
he found himself being treated as if  he  were the savage and being given
a first sketch of civilized religion—a sort of  hrossian  equivalent of
the shorter catechism  it became plain that maleldil was a spirit without
body  parts or passions 

he is not a  hnau   said the  hrossa  

what is  hnau   asked ransom 

you are  hnau   i am  hnau   the  séroni  are  hnau   the  pfifltriggi 
are  hnau  

 pfifltriggi   said ransom 

more than ten days journey to the west  said hnohra  the  harandra 
sinks down not into a  handramit  but into a broad place  an open place 
spreading every way  five days journey from the north to the south of
it  ten days journey from the east to the west  the forests are of other
colours there than here  they are blue and green  it is very deep there 
it goes to the roots of the world  the best things that can be dug out of
the earth are there  the  pfifltriggi  live there  they delight in
digging  what they dig they soften with fire and make things of it  they
are little people  smaller than you  long in the snout  pale  busy  they
have long limbs in front  no  hnau  can match them in making and shaping
things as none can match us in singing  but let  hmān  see 

he turned and spoke to one of the younger  hrossa  and presently  passed
from hand to hand  there came to him a little bowl  he held it close to
the firelight and examined it  it was certainly of gold  and ransom
realized the meaning of devines interest in malacandra 

is there much of this thing  he asked 

yes  he was told  it was washed down in most of the rivers  but the best
and most was among the  pfifltriggi   and it was they who were skilled in
it   arbol hru   they called it—suns blood  he looked at the bowl again 
it was covered with fine etching  he saw pictures of  hrossa  and of
smaller  almost frog-like animals  and then  of  sorns   he pointed to
the latter inquiringly 

 séroni   said the  hrossa   confirming his suspicions  they live up
almost on the  harandra   in the big caves 

the frog-like animals—or tapir-headed  frog-bodied animals—were
 pfifltriggi   ransom turned it over in his mind  on malacandra 
apparently  three distinct species had reached rationality  and none of
them had yet exterminated the other two  it concerned him intensely to
find out which was the real master 

which of the  hnau  rule  he asked 

oyarsa rules  was the reply 

is he  hnau  

this puzzled them a little  the  séroni   they thought  would be better
at that kind of question  perhaps oyarsa was  hnau   but a very different
 hnau   he had no death and no young 

these  séroni  know more than the  hrossa   asked ransom 

this produced more a debate than an answer  what emerged finally was that
the  séroni  or  sorns  were perfectly helpless in a boat  and could not
fish to save their lives  could hardly swim  could make no poetry  and
even when  hrossa  had made it for them could understand only the
inferior sorts  but they were admittedly good at finding out things about
the stars and understanding the darker utterances of oyarsa and telling
what happened in malacandra long ago—longer ago than anyone could
remember 

ah—the intelligentsia  thought ransom  they must be the real rulers 
however it is disguised 

he tried to ask what would happen if the  sorns  used their wisdom to
make the  hrossa  do things—this was as far as he could get in his
halting malacandrian  the question did not sound nearly so urgent in this
form as it would have done if he had been able to say used their
scientific resources for the exploitation of their uncivilized
neighbours  but he might have spared his pains  the mention of the
 sorns  inadequate appreciation of poetry had diverted the whole
conversation into literary channels  of the heated  and apparently
technical  discussion which followed he understood not a syllable 

naturally his conversations with the  hrossa  did not all turn on
malacandra  he had to repay them with information about earth  he was
hampered in this both by the humiliating discoveries which he was
constantly making of his own ignorance about his native planet  and
partly by his determination to conceal some of the truth  he did not want
to tell them too much of our human wars and industrialisms  he remembered
how h  g  wellss cavor had met his end on the moon  also he felt shy  a
sensation akin to that of physical nakedness came over him whenever they
questioned him too closely about men—the  hmāna  as they called them 
moreover  he was determined not to let them know that he had been brought
there to be given to the  sorns   for he was becoming daily more certain
that these were the dominant species  what he did tell them fired the
imagination of the  hrossa   they all began making poems about the
strange  handra  where the plants were hard like stone and the earth-weed
green like rock and the waters cold and salt  and  hmāna  lived out on
top  on the  harandra  

they were even more interested in what he had to tell them of the aquatic
animal with snapping jaws which he had fled from in their own world and
even in their own  handramit   it was a  hnakra   they all agreed  they
were intensely excited  there had not been a  hnakra  in the valley for
many years  the youth of the  hrossa  got out their weapons—primitive
harpoons with points of bone—and the very cubs began playing at
 hnakra -hunting in the shallows  some of the mothers showed signs of
anxiety and wanted the cubs to be kept out of the water  but in general
the news of the  hnakra  seemed to be immensely popular  hyoi set off at
once to do something to his boat  and ransom accompanied him  he wished
to make himself useful  and was already beginning to have some vague
capacity with the primitive  hrossian  tools  they walked together to
hyois creek  a stones throw through the forest 

on the way  where the path was single and ransom was following hyoi  they
passed a little she- hross   not much more than a cub  she spoke as they
passed  but not to them  her eyes were on a spot about five yards away 

who do you speak to  hrikki  said ransom 

to the  eldil  

where 

did you not see him 

i saw nothing 

there  there  she cried suddenly  ah  he is gone  did you not see
him 

i saw no one 

hyoi  said the cub  the  hmān  cannot see the  eldil  

but hyoi  continuing steadily on his way  was already out of earshot  and
had apparently noticed nothing  ransom concluded that hrikki was
pretending like the young of his own species  in a few moments he
rejoined his companion 




                                 twelve


they worked hard at hyois boat till noon and then spread themselves on
the weed close to the warmth of the creek  and began their midday meal 
the war-like nature of their preparations suggested many questions to
ransom  he knew no word for war  but he managed to make hyoi understand
what he wanted to know  did  séroni  and  hrossa  and  pfifltriggi  ever
go out like this  with weapons  against each other 

what for  asked hyoi 

it was difficult to explain  if both wanted one thing and neither would
give it  said ransom  would the other at last come with force  would
they say  give it or we kill you 

what sort of thing 

well—food  perhaps 

if the other  hnau  wanted food  why should we not give it to them  we
often do 

but how if we had not enough for ourselves 

but maleldil will not stop the plants growing 

hyoi  if you had more and more young  would maleldil broaden the
 handramit  and make enough plants for them all 

the  séroni  know that sort of thing  but why should we have more
young 

ransom found this difficult  at last he said 

is the begetting of young not a pleasure among the  hrossa  

a very great one   hmān   this is what we call love 

if a thing is a pleasure  a  hmān  wants it again  he might want the
pleasure more often than the number of young that could be fed 

it took hyoi a long time to get the point 

you mean  he said slowly  that he might do it not only in one or two
years of his life but again 

yes 

but why  would he want his dinner all day or want to sleep after he had
slept  i do not understand 

but a dinner comes every day  this love  you say  comes only once while
the  hross  lives 

but it takes his whole life  when he is young he has to look for his
mate  and then he has to court her  then he begets young  then he rears
them  then he remembers all this  and boils it inside him and makes it
into poems and wisdom 

but the pleasure he must be content only to remember 

that is like saying “my food i must be content only to eat ”

i do not understand 

a pleasure is full grown only when it is remembered  you are speaking 
 hmān   as if the pleasure were one thing and the memory another  it is
all one thing  the  séroni  could say it better than i say it now  not
better than i could say it in a poem  what you call remembering is the
last part of the pleasure  as the  crah  is the last part of a poem  when
you and i met  the meeting was over very shortly  it was nothing  now it
is growing something as we remember it  but still we know very little
about it  what it will be when i remember it as i lie down to die  what
it makes in me all my days till then—that is the real meeting  the other
is only the beginning of it  you say you have poets in your world  do
they not teach you this 

perhaps some of them do  said ransom  but even in a poem does a
 hross  never long to hear one splendid line over again 

hyois reply unfortunately turned on one of those points in their
language which ransom had not mastered  there were two verbs which both 
as far as he could see  meant to  long  or  yearn   but the  hrossa  drew
a sharp distinction  even an opposition  between them  hyoi seemed to him
merely to be saying that every one would long for it   wondelone   but no
one in his senses could long for it   hluntheline   

and indeed  he continued  the poem is a good example  for the most
splendid line becomes fully splendid only by means of all the lines after
it  if you went back to it you would find it less splendid than you
thought  you would kill it  i mean in a good poem 

but in a bent poem  hyoi 

a bent poem is not listened to   hmān  

and how of love in a bent life 

how could the life of a  hnau  be bent 

do you say  hyoi  that there are no bent  hrossa  

hyoi reflected  i have heard  he said at last  of something like what
you mean  it is said that sometimes here and there a cub at a certain age
gets strange twists in him  i have heard of one that wanted to eat earth 
there might  perhaps  be somewhere a  hross  likewise that wanted to have
the years of love prolonged  i have not heard of it  but it might be  i
have heard of something stranger  there is a poem about a  hross  who
lived long ago  in another  handramit   who saw things all made two—two
suns in the sky  two heads on a neck  and last of all they say that he
fell into such a frenzy that he desired two mates  i do not ask you to
believe it  but that is the story  that he loved two  hressni  

ransom pondered this  here  unless hyoi was deceiving him  was a species
naturally continent  naturally monogamous  and yet  was it so strange 
some animals  he knew  had regular breeding seasons  and if nature could
perform the miracle of turning the sexual impulse outward at all  why
could she not go further and fix it  not morally but instinctively  to a
single object  he even remembered dimly having heard that some
terrestrial animals  some of the lower animals  were naturally
monogamous  among the  hrossa   anyway  it was obvious that unlimited
breeding and promiscuity were as rare as the rarest perversions  at last
it dawned upon him that it was not they  but his own species  that were
the puzzle  that the  hrossa  should have such instincts was mildly
surprising  but how came it that the instincts of the  hrossa  so closely
resembled the unattained ideals of that far-divided species man whose
instincts were so deplorably different  what was the history of man  but
hyoi was speaking again 

undoubtedly  he said  maleldil made us so  how could there ever be
enough to eat if everyone had twenty young  and how could we endure to
live and let time pass if we were always crying for one day or one year
to come back—if we did not know that every day in a life fills the whole
life with expectation and memory and that these  are  that day 

all the same  said ransom  unconsciously nettled on behalf of his own
world  maleldil has let in the  hnakra  

oh  but that is so different  i long to kill this  hnakra  as he also
longs to kill me  i hope that my ship will be the first and i first in my
ship with my straight spear when the black jaws snap  and if he kills me 
my people will mourn and my brothers will desire still more to kill him 
but they will not wish that there were no  hnéraki   nor do i  how can i
make you understand  when you do not understand the poets  the  hnakra 
is our enemy  but he is also our beloved  we feel in our hearts his joy
as he looks down from the mountain of water in the north where he was
born  we leap with him when he jumps the falls  and when winter comes 
and the lake smokes higher than our heads  it is with his eyes that we
see it and know that his roaming time is come  we hang images of him in
our houses  and the sign of all the  hrossa  is a  hnakra   in him the
spirit of the valley lives  and our young play at being  hnéraki  as soon
as they can splash in the shallows 

and then he kills them 

not often them  the  hrossa  would be bent  hrossa  if they let him get
so near  long before he had come down so far we should have sought him
out  no   hmān   it is not a few deaths roving the world around him that
make a  hnau  miserable  it is a bent  hnau  that would blacken the
world  and i say also this  i do not think the forest would be so bright 
nor the water so warm  nor love so sweet  if there were no danger in the
lakes  i will tell you a day in my life that has shaped me  such a day as
comes only once  like love  or serving oyarsa in meldilorn  then i was
young  not much more than a cub  when i went far  far up the  handramit 
to the land where stars shine at midday and even water is cold  a great
waterfall i climbed  i stood on the shore of balki the pool  which is the
place of most awe in all worlds  the walls of it go up for ever and ever
and huge and holy images are cut in them  the work of old times  there is
the fall called the mountain of water  because i have stood there alone 
maleldil and i  for even oyarsa sent me no word  my heart has been
higher  my song deeper  all my days  but do you think it would have been
so unless i had known that in balki  hnéraki  dwelled  there i drank life
because death was in the pool  that was the best of drinks save one 

what one  asked ransom 

death itself in the day i drink it and go to maleldil 

shortly after that they rose and resumed their work  the sun was
declining as they came back through the wood  it occurred to ransom to
ask hyoi a question 

hyoi  he said  it comes into my head that when i first saw you and
before you saw me  you were already speaking  that was how i knew that
you were  hnau   for otherwise i should have thought you a beast  and run
away  but who were you speaking to 

to an  eldil  

what is that  i saw no one 

are there no  eldila  in your world   hmān   that must be strange 

but what are they 

they come from oyarsa—they are  i suppose  a kind of  hnau  

as we came out to-day i passed a child who said she was talking to an
 eldil   but i could see nothing 

one can see by looking at your eyes   hmān   that they are different
from ours  but  eldila  are hard to see  they are not like us  light goes
through them  you must be looking in the right place and the right time 
and that is not likely to come about unless the  eldil  wishes to be
seen  sometimes you can mistake them for a sunbeam or even a moving of
the leaves  but when you look again you see that it was an  eldil  and
that it is gone  but whether your eyes can ever see them i do not know 
the  séroni  would know that 




                                thirteen


the whole village was astir next morning before the sunlight—already
visible on the  harandra —had penetrated the forest  by the light of the
cooking-fires ransom saw an incessant activity of  hrossa   the females
were pouring out steaming food from clumsy pots  hnohra was directing the
transportation of piles of spears to the boats  hyoi  in the midst of a
group of the most experienced hunters  was talking too rapidly and too
technically for ransom to follow  parties were arriving from the
neighbouring villages  and the cubs  squealing with excitement  were
running hither and thither among their elders 

he found that his own share in the hunt had been taken for granted  he
was to be in hyois boat  with hyoi and whin  the two  hrossa  would take
it in turns to paddle  while ransom and the disengaged  hross  would be
in the bows  he understood the  hrossa  well enough now to know that they
were making him the noblest offer in their power  and that hyoi and whin
were each tormented by the fear lest he should be paddling when the
 hnakra  appeared  a short time ago  in england  nothing would have
seemed more impossible to ransom than to accept the post of honour and
danger in an attack upon an unknown but certainly deadly aquatic monster 
even more recently  when he had first fled from the  sorns   or when he
had lain pitying himself in the forest by night  it would hardly have
been in his power to do what he was intending to do to-day  for his
intention was clear  whatever happened  he must show that the human
species also were  hnau   he was only too well aware that such
resolutions might look very different when the moment came  but he felt
an unwonted assurance that somehow or other he would be able to go
through with it  it was necessary  and the necessary was always possible 
perhaps  too  there was something in the air he now breathed  or in the
society of the  hrossa   which had begun to work a change in him 

the lake was just giving back the first rays of the sun when he found
himself kneeling side by side with whin  as he had been told to  in the
bows of hyois ship  with a little pile of throwing-spears between his
knees and one in his right hand  stiffening his body against the motion
as hyoi paddled them out into their place  at least a hundred boats were
taking part in the hunt  they were in three parties  the central  and far
the smallest  was to work its way up the current by which hyoi and ransom
had descended after their first meeting  longer ships than he had yet
seen  eight-paddled ships  were used for this  the habit of the  hnakra 
was to float down the current whenever he could  meeting the ships  he
would presumably dart out of it into the still water to left or right 
hence while the central party slowly beat up the current  the light
ships  paddling far faster  would cruise at will up and down either side
of it to receive the quarry as soon as he broke what might be called his
cover  in this game numbers and intelligence were on the side of the
 hrossa   the  hnakra  had speed on his side  and also invisibility  for
he could swim under water  he was nearly invulnerable except through his
open mouth  if the two hunters in the bows of the boat he made for muffed
their shots  this was usually the last of them and of their boat 

in the light skirmishing parties there were two things a brave hunter
could aim at  he could keep well back and close to the long-ships where
the  hnakra  was most likely to break out  or he could get as far forward
as possible in the hope of meeting the  hnakra  going at its full speed
and yet untroubled by the hunt  and of inducing it  by a well-aimed
spear  to leave the current then and there  one could thus anticipate the
beaters and kill the beast—if that was how the matter ended—on ones own 
this was the desire of hyoi and whin  and almost—so strongly they
infected him—of ransom  hence  hardly had the heavy craft of the beaters
begun their slow progress up-current amid a wall of foam when he found
his own ship speeding northward as fast as hyoi could drive her  already
passing boat after boat and making for the freest water  the speed was
exhilarating  in the cold morning the warmth of the blue expanse they
were clearing was not unpleasant  behind them arose  re-echoed from the
remote rock pinnacles on either side of the valley  the bell-like 
deep-mouthed voices of more than two hundred  hrossa   more musical than
a cry of hounds but closely akin to it in quality as in purport 
something long sleeping in the blood awoke in ransom  it did not seem
impossible at this moment that even he might be the  hnakra -slayer  that
the fame of  hmān hnakrapunt  might be handed down to posterity in this
world that knew no other man  but he had had such dreams before  and knew
how they ended  imposing humility on the newly risen riot of his
feelings  he turned his eyes to the troubled water of the current which
they were skirting  without entering  and watched intently 

for a long time nothing happened  he became conscious of the stiffness of
his attitude and deliberately relaxed his muscles  presently whin
reluctantly went aft to paddle  and hyoi came forward to take his place 
almost as soon as the change had been effected  hyoi spoke softly to him
and said  without taking his eyes off the current 

there is an  eldil  coming to us over the water 

ransom could see nothing—or nothing that he could distinguish from
imagination and the dance of sunlight on the lake  a moment later hyoi
spoke again  but not to him 

what is it  sky-born 

what happened next was the most uncanny experience ransom had yet had on
malacandra  he heard the voice  it seemed to come out of the air  about a
yard above his head  and it was almost an octave higher than the
 hrosss —higher even than his own  he realized that a very little
difference in his ear would have made the  eldil  as inaudible to him as
it was invisible 

it is the man with you  hyoi  said the voice  he ought not to be
there  he ought to be going to oyarsa  bent  hnau  of his own kind from
thulcandra are following him  he should go to oyarsa  if they find him
anywhere else there will be evil 

he hears you  sky-born  said hyoi  and have you no message for my
wife  you know what she wishes to be told 

i have a message for hleri  said the  eldil   but you will not be able
to take it  i go to her now myself  all that is well  only—let the man go
to oyarsa 

there was a moments silence 

he is gone  said whin  and we have lost our share in the hunt 

yes  said hyoi with a sigh  we must put  hmān  ashore and teach him
the way to meldilorn 

ransom was not so sure of his courage but that one part of him felt an
instant relief at the idea of any diversion from their present business 
but the other part of him urged him to hold on to his newfound manhood 
now or never—with such companions or with none—he must leave a deed on
his memory instead of one more broken dream  it was in obedience to
something like conscience that he exclaimed 

no  no  there is time for that after the hunt  we must kill the  hnakra 
first 

once an  eldil  has spoken  began hyoi  when suddenly whin gave a great
cry  a bark ransom would have called it three weeks ago  and pointed 
there  not a furlong away  was the torpedo-like track of foam  and now 
visible through a wall of foam  they caught the metallic glint of the
monsters sides  whin was paddling furiously  hyoi threw and missed  as
his first spear smote the water his second was already in the air  this
time it must have touched the  hnakra   he wheeled right out of the
current  ransom saw the great black pit of his mouth twice open and twice
shut with its snap of shark-like teeth  he himself had thrown
now—hurriedly  excitedly  with unpractised hand 

back  shouted hyoi to whin who was already backing water with every
pound of his vast strength  then all became confused  he heard whin shout
shore  there came a shock that flung him forward almost into the
 hnakras  jaws and he found himself at the same moment up to his waist
in water  it was at him the teeth were snapping  then as he flung shaft
after shaft into the great cavern of the gaping brute he saw hyoi perched
incredibly on its back—on its nose—bending forward and hurling from
there  almost at once the  hross  was dislodged and fell with a wide
splash nearly ten yards away  but the  hnakra  was killed  it was
wallowing on its side  bubbling out its black life  the water around him
was dark and stank 

when he recollected himself they were all on shore  wet  steaming 
trembling with exertion and embracing one another  it did not now seem
strange to him to be clasped to a breast of wet fur  the breath of the
 hrossa  which  though sweet  was not human breath  did not offend him 
he was one with them  that difficulty which they  accustomed to more than
one rational species  had perhaps never felt  was now overcome  they were
all  hnau   they had stood shoulder to shoulder in the face of an enemy 
and the shapes of their heads no longer mattered  and he  even ransom 
had come through it and not been disgraced  he had grown up 

they were on a little promontory free of forest  on which they had run
aground in the confusion of the fight  the wreckage of the boat and the
corpse of the monster lay confused together in the water beside them  no
sound from the rest of the hunting party was audible  they had been
almost a mile ahead when they met the  hnakra   all three sat down to
recover their breath 

so  said hyoi  we are  hnakrapunti   this is what i have wanted all my
life 

at that moment ransom was deafened by a loud sound—a perfectly familiar
sound which was the last thing he expected to hear  it was a terrestrial 
human and civilized sound  it was even european  it was the crack of an
english rifle  and hyoi  at his feet  was struggling to rise and gasping 
there was blood on the white weed where he struggled  ransom dropped on
his knees beside him  the huge body of the  hross  was too heavy for him
to turn round  whin helped him 

hyoi  can you hear me  said ransom with his face close to the round
seal-like head  hyoi  it is through me that this has happened  it is the
other  hmāna  who have hit you  the bent two that brought me to
malacandra  they can throw death at a distance with a thing they have
made  i should have told you  we are all a bent race  we have come here
to bring evil on malacandra  we are only half  hnau —hyoi       his
speech died away into the inarticulate  he did not know the words for
forgive  or shame  or fault  hardly the word for sorry  he could
only stare into hyois distorted face in speechless guilt  but the
 hross  seemed to understand  it was trying to say something  and ransom
laid his ear close to the working mouth  hyois dulling eyes were fixed
on his own  but the expression of a  hross  was not even now perfectly
intelligible to him 

 hnā—hmā   it muttered and then  at last   hmān hnakrapunt   then
there came a contortion of the whole body  a gush of blood and saliva
from the mouth  his arms gave way under the sudden dead weight of the
sagging head  and hyois face became as alien and animal as it had seemed
at their first meeting  the glazed eyes and the slowly stiffening 
bedraggled fur  were like those of any dead beast found in an earthly
wood 

ransom resisted an infantile impulse to break out into imprecations on
weston and devine  instead he raised his eyes to meet those of whin who
was crouching— hrossa  do not kneel—on the other side of the corpse 

i am in the hands of your people  whin  he said  they must do as they
will  but if they are wise they will kill me and certainly they will kill
the other two 

one does not kill  hnau   said whin  only oyarsa does that  but these
other  where are they 

ransom glanced around  it was open on the promontory but thick wood came
down to where it joined the mainland  perhaps two hundred yards away 

somewhere in the wood  he said  lie down  whin  here where the ground
is lowest  they may throw from their thing again 

he had some difficulty in making whin do as he suggested  when both were
lying in dead ground  their feet almost in the water  the  hross  spoke
again 

why did they kill him  he asked 

they would not know he was  hnau   said ransom  i have told you that
there is only one kind of  hnau  in our world  they would think he was a
beast  if they thought that  they would kill him for pleasure  or in
fear  or  he hesitated  because they were hungry  but i must tell you
the truth  whin  they would kill even a  hnau   knowing it to be  hnau  
if they thought its death would serve them 

there was a short silence 

i am wondering  said ransom  if they saw me  it is for me they are
looking  perhaps if i went to them they would be content and come no
farther into your land  but why do they not come out of the wood to see
what they have killed 

our people are coming  said whin  turning his head  ransom looked back
and saw the lake black with boats  the main body of the hunt would be
with them in a few minutes 

they are afraid of the  hrossa   said ransom  that is why they do not
come out of the wood  i will go to them  whin 

no  said whin  i have been thinking  all this has come from not
obeying the  eldil   he said you were to go to oyarsa  you ought to have
been already on the road  you must go now 

but that will leave the bent  hmāna  here  they may do more harm 

they will not set on the  hrossa   you have said they are afraid  it is
more likely that we will come upon them  never fear—they will not see us
or hear us  we will take them to oyarsa  but you must go now  as the
 eldil  said 

your people will think i have run away because i am afraid to look in
their faces after hyois death 

it is not a question of thinking but of what an  eldil  says  this is
cubs talk  now listen  and i will teach you the way 

the  hross  explained to him that five days journey to the south the
 handramit  joined another  handramit   and three days up this other
 handramit  to west and north was meldilorn and the seat of oyarsa  but
there was a shorter way  a mountain road  across the corner of the
 harandra  between the two canyons  which would bring him down to
meldilorn on the second day  he must go into the wood before them and
through it till he came to the mountain wall of the  handramit   and he
must work south along the roots of the mountains till he came to a road
cut up between them  up this he must go  and somewhere beyond the tops of
the mountains he would come to the tower of augray  augray would help
him  he could cut weed for his food before he left the forest and came
into the rock country  whin realized that ransom might meet the other two
 hmāna  as soon as he entered the wood 

if they catch you  he said  then it will be as you say  they will come
no farther into our land  but it is better to be taken on your way to
oyarsa than to stay here  and once you are on the way to him  i do not
think he will let the bent ones stop you 

ransom was by no means convinced that this was the best plan either for
himself or for the  hrossa   but the stupor of humiliation in which he
had lain ever since hyoi fell forbade him to criticize  he was anxious
only to do whatever they wanted him to do  to trouble them as little as
was now possible  and above all to get away  it was impossible to find
out how whin felt  and ransom sternly repressed an insistent  whining
impulse to renewed protestations and regrets  self-accusations that might
elicit some word of pardon  hyoi with his last breath had called him
 hnakra -slayer  that was forgiveness generous enough and with that he
must be content  as soon as he had mastered the details of his route he
bade farewell to whin and advanced alone towards the forest 




                                fourteen


until he reached the wood ransom found it difficult to think of anything
except the possibility of another rifle bullet from weston or devine  he
thought that they probably still wanted him alive rather than dead  and
this  combined with the knowledge that a  hross  was watching him 
enabled him to proceed with at least external composure  even when he had
entered the forest he felt himself in considerable danger  the long
branchless stems made cover only if you were very far away from the
enemy  and the enemy in this case might be very close  he became aware of
a strong impulse to shout out to weston and devine and give himself up 
it rationalized itself in the form that this would remove them from the
district  as they would probably take him off to the  sorns  and leave
the  hrossa  unmolested  but ransom knew a little psychology and had
heard of the hunted mans irrational instinct to give himself up—indeed 
he had felt it himself in dreams  it was some such trick  he thought 
that his nerves were now playing him  in any case he was determined
henceforward to obey the  hrossa  or  eldila   his efforts to rely on his
own judgment in malacandra had so far ended tragically enough  he made a
strong resolution  defying in advance all changes of mood  that he would
faithfully carry out the journey to meldilorn if it could be done 

this resolution seemed to him all the more certainly right because he had
the deepest misgivings about that journey  he understood that the
 harandra   which he had to cross  was the home of the  sorns   in fact
he was walking of his own free will into the very trap that he had been
trying to avoid ever since his arrival on malacandra   here the first
change of mood tried to raise its head  he thrust it down   and even if
he got through the  sorns  and reached meldilorn  who or what might
oyarsa be  oyarsa  whin had ominously observed  did not share the
 hrossas  objection to shedding the blood of a  hnau   and again  oyarsa
ruled  sorns  as well as  hrossa  and  pfifltriggi   perhaps he was
simply the arch- sorn   and now came the second change of mood  those old
terrestrial fears of some alien  cold intelligence  superhuman in power 
sub-human in cruelty  which had utterly faded from his mind among the
 hrossa   rose clamouring for readmission  but he strode on  he was going
to meldilorn  it was not possible  he told himself  that the  hrossa 
should obey any evil or monstrous creature  and they had told him—or had
they  he was not quite sure—that oyarsa was not a  sorn   was oyarsa a
god —perhaps that very idol to whom the  sorns  wanted to sacrifice him 
but the  hrossa   though they said strange things about him  clearly
denied that he was a god  there was one god  according to them  maleldil
the young  nor was it possible to imagine hyoi or hnohra worshipping a
bloodstained idol  unless  of course  the  hrossa  were after all under
the thumb of the  sorns   superior to their masters in all the qualities
that human beings value  but intellectually inferior to them and
dependent on them  it would be a strange but not an inconceivable world 
heroism and poetry at the bottom  cold scientific intellect above it  and
overtopping all some dark superstition which scientific intellect 
helpless against the revenge of the emotional depths it had ignored  had
neither will nor power to remove  a mumbo-jumbo       but ransom pulled
himself up  he knew too much now to talk that way  he and all his class
would have called the  eldila  a superstition if they had been merely
described to them  but now he had heard the voice himself  no  oyarsa was
a real person if he was a person at all 

he had now been walking for about an hour  and it was nearly midday  no
difficulty about his direction had yet occurred  he had merely to keep
going uphill and he was certain of coming out of the forest to the
mountain wall sooner or later  meanwhile he felt remarkably well  though
greatly chastened in mind  the silent  purple half-light of the woods
spread all around him as it had spread on the first day he spent in
malacandra  but everything else was changed  he looked back on that time
as on a nightmare  on his own mood at that time as a sort of sickness 
then all had been whimpering  unanalysed  self-nourishing  self-consuming
dismay  now  in the clear light of an accepted duty  he felt fear indeed 
but with it a sober sense of confidence in himself and in the world  and
even an element of pleasure  it was the difference between a landsman in
a sinking ship and a horseman on a bolting horse  either may be killed 
but the horseman is an agent as well as a patient 

about an hour after noon he suddenly came out of the wood into bright
sunshine  he was only twenty yards from the almost perpendicular bases of
the mountain spires  too close to them to see their tops  a sort of
valley ran up in the re-entrant between two of them at the place where he
had emerged  an unclimbable valley consisting of a single concave sweep
of stone  which in its lower parts ascended steeply as the roof of a
house and farther up seemed almost vertical  at the top it even looked as
if it hung over a bit  like a tidal wave of stone at the very moment of
breaking  but this  he thought  might be an illusion  he wondered what
the  hrossas  idea of a road might be 

he began to work his way southward along the narrow  broken ground
between wood and mountain  great spurs of the mountains had to be crossed
every few moments  and even in that light-weight world it was intensely
tiring  after about half an hour he came to a stream  here he went a few
paces into the forest  cut himself an ample supply of the groundweed  and
sat down beside the waters edge for lunch  when he had finished he
filled his pockets with what he had not eaten and proceeded 

he began soon to be anxious about his road  for if he could make the top
at all he could do it only by daylight  and the middle of the afternoon
was approaching  but his fears were unnecessary  when it came it was
unmistakable  an open way through the wood appeared on the left—he must
be somewhere behind the  hross  village now—and on the right he saw the
road  a single ledge or  in places  a trench  cut sidewise and upwards
across the sweep of such a valley as he had seen before  it took his
breath away—the insanely steep  hideously narrow staircase without steps 
leading up and up from where he stood to where it was an almost invisible
thread on the pale green surface of the rock  but there was no time to
stand and look at it  he was a poor judge of heights  but he had no doubt
that the top of the road was removed from him by a more than alpine
distance  it would take him at least till sundown to reach it  instantly
he began the ascent 

such a journey would have been impossible on earth  the first quarter of
an hour would have reduced a man of ransoms build and age to exhaustion 
here he was at first delighted with the ease of his movement  and then
staggered by the gradient and length of the climb which  even under
malacandrian conditions  soon bowed his back and gave him an aching chest
and trembling knees  but this was not the worst  he heard already a
singing in his ears  and noticed that despite his labour there was no
sweat on his forehead  the cold  increasing at every step  seemed to sap
his vitality worse than any heat could have done  already his lips were
cracked  his breath  as he panted  showed like a cloud  his fingers were
numb  he was cutting his way up into a silent arctic world  and had
already passed from an english to a lapland winter  it frightened him 
and he decided that he must rest here or not at all  a hundred paces more
and if he sat down he would sit for ever  he squatted on the road for a
few minutes  slapping his body with his arms  the landscape was
terrifying  already the  handramit  which had made his world for so many
weeks was only a thin purple cleft sunk amidst the boundless level
desolation of the  harandra  which now  on the farther side  showed
clearly between and above the mountain peaks  but long before he was
rested he knew that he must go on or die 

the world grew stranger  among the  hrossa  he had almost lost the
feeling of being on a strange planet  here it returned upon him with
desolating force  it was no longer the world  scarcely even a world 
it was a planet  a star  a waste place in the universe  millions of miles
from the world of men  it was impossible to recall what he had felt about
hyoi  or whin  or the  eldila   or oyarsa  it seemed fantastic to have
thought he had duties to such hobgoblins—if they were not
hallucinations—met in the wilds of space  he had nothing to do with them 
he was a man  why had weston and devine left him alone like this 

but all the time the old resolution  taken when he could still think  was
driving him up the road  often he forgot where he was going  and why  the
movement became a mechanical rhythm—from weariness to stillness  from
stillness to unbearable cold  from cold to motion again  he noticed that
the  handramit —now an insignificant part of the landscape—was full of a
sort of haze  he had never seen a fog while he was living there  perhaps
that was what the air of the  handramit  looked like from above 
certainly it was different air from this  there was something more wrong
with his lungs and heart than even the cold and the exertion accounted
for  and though there was no snow  there was an extraordinary brightness 
the light was increasing  sharpening and growing whiter  and the sky was
a much darker blue than he had ever seen on malacandra  indeed  it was
darker than blue  it was almost black  and the jagged spires of rock
standing against it were like his mental picture of a lunar landscape 
some stars were visible 

suddenly he realized the meaning of these phenomena  there was very
little air above him  he was near the end of it  the malacandrian
atmosphere lay chiefly in the  handramits   the real surface of the
planet was naked or thinly clad  the stabbing sunlight and the black sky
above him were that heaven out of which he had dropped into the
malacandrian world  already showing through the last thin veil of air  if
the top were more than a hundred feet away  it would be where no man
could breathe at all  he wondered whether the  hrossa  had different
lungs and had sent him by a road that meant death for man  but even while
he thought of this he took note that those jagged peaks blazing in
sunlight against an almost black sky were level with him  he was no
longer ascending  the road ran on before him in a kind of shallow ravine
bounded on his left by the tops of the highest rock pinnacles and on his
right by a smooth ascending swell of stone that ran up to the true
 harandra   and where he was he could still breathe  though gasping 
dizzy and in pain  the blaze in his eyes was worse  the sun was setting 
the  hrossa  must have foreseen this  they could not live  any more than
he  on the  harandra  by night  still staggering forward  he looked about
him for any sign of augrays tower  whatever augray might be 

doubtless he exaggerated the time during which he thus wandered and
watched the shadows from the rocks lengthening towards him  it cannot
really have been long before he saw a light ahead—a light which showed
how dark the surrounding landscape had become  he tried to run but his
body would not respond  stumbling in haste and weakness  he made for the
light  thought he had reached it and found that it was far farther off
than he had supposed  almost despaired  staggered on again  and came at
last to what seemed a cavern mouth  the light within was an unsteady one
and a delicious wave of warmth smote on his face  it was firelight  he
came into the mouth of the cave and then  unsteadily  round the fire and
into the interior  and stood still blinking in the light  when at last he
could see  he discerned a smooth chamber of green rock  very lofty  there
were two things in it  one of them  dancing on the wall and roof  was the
huge  angular shadow of a  sorn   the other  crouched beneath it  was the
 sorn  himself 




                                fifteen


come in  small one  boomed the  sorn   come in and let me look at
you 

now that he stood face to face with the spectre that had haunted him ever
since he set foot on malacandra  ransom felt a surprising indifference 
he had no idea what might be coming next  but he was determined to carry
out his programme  and in the meantime the warmth and more breathable air
were a heaven in themselves  he came in  well in past the fire  and
answered the  sorn   his own voice sounded to him a shrill treble 

the  hrossa  have sent me to look for oyarsa  he said 

the  sorn  peered at him  you are not from this world  it said
suddenly 

no  replied ransom  and sat down  he was too tired to explain 

i think you are from thulcandra  small one  said the  sorn  

why  said ransom 

you are small and thick and that is how the animals ought to be made in
a heavier world  you cannot come from glundandra  for it is so heavy that
if any animals could live there they would be flat like plates—even you 
small one  would break if you stood up on that world  i do not think you
are from parelandra  for it must be very hot  if any came from there they
would not live when they arrived here  so i conclude you are from
thulcandra 

the world i come from is called earth by those who live there  said
ransom  and it is much warmer than this  before i came into your cave i
was nearly dead with cold and thin air 

the  sorn  made a sudden movement with one of its long fore-limbs  ransom
stiffened  though he did not allow himself to retreat   for the creature
might be going to grab him  in fact  its intentions were kindly 
stretching back into the cave  it took from the wall what looked like a
cup  then ransom saw that it was attached to a length of flexible tube 
the  sorn  put it into his hands 

smell on this  it said  the  hrossa  also need it when they pass this
way 

ransom inhaled and was instantly refreshed  his painful shortness of
breath was eased and the tension of chest and temples was relaxed  the
 sorn  and the lighted cavern  hitherto vague and dream-like to his eyes 
took on a new reality 

oxygen  he asked  but naturally the english word meant nothing to the
 sorn  

are you called augray  he asked 

yes  said the  sorn   what are you called 

the animal i am is called man  and therefore the  hrossa  call me
 hmān   but my own name is ransom 

man—ren-soom  said the  sorn   he noticed that it spoke differently
from the  hrossa   without any suggestion of their persistent initial h 

it was sitting on its long  wedge-shaped buttocks with its feet drawn
close up to it  a man in the same posture would have rested his chin on
his knees  but the  sorns  legs were too long for that  its knees rose
high above its shoulders on each side of its head—grotesquely suggestive
of huge ears—and the head  down between them  rested its chin on the
protruding breast  the creature seemed to have either a double chin or a
beard  ransom could not make out which in the firelight  it was mainly
white or cream in colour and seemed to be clothed down to the ankles in
some soft substance that reflected the light  on the long fragile shanks 
where the creature was closest to him  he saw that this was some natural
kind of coat  it was not like fur but more like feathers  in fact it was
almost exactly like feathers  the whole animal  seen at close quarters 
was less terrifying than he had expected  and even a little smaller  the
face  it was true  took a good deal of getting used to—it was too long 
too solemn and too colourless  and it was much more unpleasantly like a
human face than any inhuman creatures face ought to be  its eyes  like
those of all very large creatures  seemed too small for it  but it was
more grotesque than horrible  a new conception of the  sorns  began to
arise in his mind  the ideas of giant and ghost receded behind those
of goblin and gawk 

perhaps you are hungry  small one  it said 

ransom was  the  sorn  rose with strange spidery movements and began
going to and fro about the cave  attended by its thin goblin shadow  it
brought him the usual vegetable foods of malacandra  and strong drink 
with the very welcome addition of a smooth brown substance which revealed
itself to nose  eye and palate  in defiance of all probability  as
cheese  ransom asked what it was 

the  sorn  began to explain painfully how the female of some animals
secreted a fluid for the nourishment of its young  and would have gone on
to describe the whole process of milking and cheesemaking  if ransom had
not interrupted it 

yes  yes  he said  we do the same on earth  what is the beast you
use 

it is a yellow beast with a long neck  it feeds on the forests that grow
in the  handramit   the young ones of our people who are not yet fit for
much else drive the beasts down there in the mornings and follow them
while they feed  then before night they drive them back and put them in
the caves 

for a moment ransom found something reassuring in the thought that the
 sorns  were shepherds  then he remembered that the cyclops in homer
plied the same trade 

i think i have seen one of your people at this very work  he said  but
the  hrossa —they let you tear up their forests 

why should they not 

do you rule the  hrossa  

oyarsa rules them 

and who rules you 

oyarsa 

but you know more than the  hrossa  

the  hrossa  know nothing except about poems and fish and making things
grow out of the ground 

and oyarsa—is he a  sorn  

no  no  small one  i have told you he rules all  nau   so he pronounced
 hnau    and everything in malacandra 

i do not understand this oyarsa  said ransom  tell me more 

oyarsa does not die  said the  sorn   and he does not breed  he is the
one of his kind who was put into malacandra to rule it when malacandra
was made  his body is not like ours  nor yours  it is hard to see and the
light goes through it 

like an  eldil  

yes  he is the greatest of  eldila  who ever come to a  handra  

what are these  eldila  

do you tell me  small one  that there are no  eldila  in your world 

not that i know of  but what are  eldila   and why can i not see them 
have they no bodies 

of course they have bodies  there are a great many bodies you cannot
see  every animals eyes see some things but not others  do you not know
of many kinds of body in thulcandra 

ransom tried to give the  sorn  some idea of the terrestrial terminology
of solids  liquids and gases  it listened with great attention 

that is not the way to say it  it replied  body is movement  if it is
at one speed  you smell something  if at another  you hear a sound  if at
another  you see a sight  if at another  you neither see nor hear nor
smell  nor know the body in any way  but mark this  small one  that the
two ends meet 

how do you mean 

if movement is faster  then that which moves is more nearly in two
places at once 

that is true 

but if the movement were faster still—it is difficult  for you do not
know many words—you see that if you made it faster and faster  in the end
the moving thing would be in all places at once  small one 

i think i see that 

well  then  that is the thing at the top of all bodies—so fast that it
is at rest  so truly body that it has ceased being body at all  but we
will not talk of that  start from where we are  small one  the swiftest
thing that touches our senses is light  we do not truly see light  we
only see slower things lit by it  so that for us light is on the edge—the
last thing we know before things become too swift for us  but the body of
an  eldil  is a movement swift as light  you may say its body is made of
light  but not of that which is light for the  eldil   his “light” is a
swifter movement which for us is nothing at all  and what we call light
is for him a thing like water  a visible thing  a thing he can touch and
bathe in—even a dark thing when not illumined by the swifter  and what we
call firm things—flesh and earth—seem to him thinner  and harder to see 
than our light  and more like clouds  and nearly nothing  to us the
 eldil  is a thin  half-real body that can go through walls and rocks  to
himself he goes through them because he is solid and firm and they are
like cloud  and what is true light to him and fills the heaven  so that
he will plunge into the rays of the sun to refresh himself from it  is to
us the black nothing in the sky at night  these things are not strange 
small one  though they are beyond our senses  but it is strange that the
 eldila  never visit thulcandra 

of that i am not certain  said ransom  it had dawned on him that the
recurrent human tradition of bright  elusive people sometimes appearing
on the earth— albs    devas  and the like—might after all have another
explanation than the anthropologists had yet given  true  it would turn
the universe rather oddly inside out  but his experiences in the
space-ship had prepared him for some such operation 

why does oyarsa send for me  he asked 

oyarsa has not told me  said the  sorn   but doubtless he would want
to see any stranger from another  handra  

we have no oyarsa in my world  said ransom 

that is another proof  said the  sorn   that you come from thulcandra 
the silent planet 

what has that to do with it 

the  sorn  seemed surprised  it is not very likely if you had an oyarsa
that he would never speak to ours 

speak to yours  but how could he—it is millions of miles away 

oyarsa would not think of it like that 

do you mean that he ordinarily receives messages from other planets 

once again  he would not say it that way  oyarsa would not say that he
lives on malacandra and that another oyarsa lives on another earth  for
him malacandra is only a place in the heavens  it is in the heavens that
he and the others live  of course they talk together       

ransoms mind shied away from the problem  he was getting sleepy and
thought he must be misunderstanding the  sorn  

i think i must sleep  augray  he said  and i do not know what you are
saying  perhaps  too  i do not come from what you call thulcandra 

we will both sleep presently  said the  sorn   but first i will show
you thulcandra 

it rose and ransom followed it into the back of the cave  here he found a
little recess and running up within it a winding stair  the steps  hewn
for  sorns   were too high for a man to climb with any comfort  but using
hands and knees he managed to hobble up  the  sorn  preceded him  ransom
did not understand the light  which seemed to come from some small round
object which the creature held in its hand  they went up a long way 
almost as if they were climbing up the inside of a hollow mountain  at
last  breathless  he found himself in a dark but warm chamber of rock 
and heard the  sorn  saying 

she is still well above the southern horizon  it directed his attention
to something like a small window  whatever it was  it did not appear to
work like an earthly telescope  ransom thought  though an attempt  made
next day  to explain the principles of the telescope to the  sorn  threw
grave doubts on his own ability to discern the difference  he leaned
forward with his elbows on the sill of the aperture and looked  he saw
perfect blackness and  floating in the centre of it  seemingly an arms
length away  a bright disk about the size of a half-crown  most of its
surface was featureless  shining silver  towards the bottom markings
appeared  and below them a white cap  just as he had seen the polar caps
in astronomical photographs of mars  he wondered for a moment if it was
mars he was looking at  then  as his eyes took in the markings better  he
recognized what they were—northern europe and a piece of north america 
they were upside down with the north pole at the bottom of the picture
and this somehow shocked him  but it was earth he was seeing—even 
perhaps  england  though the picture shook a little and his eyes were
quickly getting tired  and he could not be certain that he was not
imagining it  it was all there in that little disk—london  athens 
jerusalem  shakespeare  there everyone had lived and everything had
happened  and there  presumably  his pack was still lying in the porch of
an empty house near sterk 

yes  he said dully to the  sorn   that is my world  it was the
bleakest moment in all his travels 




                                sixteen


ransom awoke next morning with the vague feeling that a great weight had
been taken off his mind  then he remembered that he was the guest of a
 sorn  and that the creature he had been avoiding ever since he landed
had turned out to be as amicable as the  hrossa   though he was far from
feeling the same affection for it  nothing then remained to be afraid of
in malacandra except oyarsa       the last fence  thought ransom 

augray gave him food and drink 

and now  said ransom  how shall i find my way to oyarsa 

i will carry you  said the  sorn   you are too small a one to make the
journey yourself and i will gladly go to meldilorn  the  hrossa  should
not have sent you this way  they do not seem to know from looking at an
animal what sort of lungs it has and what it can do  it is just like a
 hross   if you died on the  harandra  they would have made a poem about
the gallant hmān and how the sky grew black and the cold stars shone and
he journeyed on and journeyed on  and they would have put in a fine
speech for you to say as you were dying       and all this would seem to
them just as good as if they had used a little forethought and saved your
life by sending you the easier way round 

i like the  hrossa   said ransom a little stiffly  and i think the way
they talk about death is the right way 

they are right not to fear it  ren-soom  but they do not seem to look at
it reasonably as part of the very nature of our bodies—and therefore
often avoidable at times when they would never see how to avoid it  for
example  this has saved the life of many a  hross   but a  hross  would
not have thought of it 

he showed ransom a flask with a tube attached to it  and  at the end of
the tube a cup  obviously an apparatus for administering oxygen to
oneself 

smell on it as you have need  small one  said the  sorn   and close it
up when you do not 

augray fastened the thing on his back and gave the tube over his shoulder
into his hand  ransom could not restrain a shudder at the touch of the
 sorns  hands upon his body  they were fan-shaped  seven-fingered  mere
skin over bone like a birds leg  and quite cold  to divert his mind from
such reactions he asked where the apparatus was made  for he had as yet
seen nothing remotely like a factory or a laboratory 

we thought it  said the  sorn   and the  pfifltriggi  made it 

why do they make them  said ransom  he was trying once more  with his
insufficient vocabulary  to find out the political and economic framework
of malacandrian life 

they like making things  said augray  it is true they like best the
making of things that are only good to look at and of no use  but
sometimes when they are tired of that they will make things for us 
things we have thought  provided they are difficult enough  they have not
patience to make easy things however useful they would be  but let us
begin our journey  you shall sit on my shoulder 

the proposal was unexpected and alarming  but seeing that the  sorn  had
already crouched down  ransom felt obliged to climb on to the plume-like
surface of its shoulder  to seat himself beside the long  pale face 
casting his right arm as far as it would go round the huge neck  and to
compose himself as well as he could for this precarious mode of travel 
the giant rose cautiously to a standing position and he found himself
looking down on the landscape from a height of about eighteen feet 

is all well  small one  it asked 

very well  ransom answered  and the journey began 

its gait was perhaps the least human thing about it  it lifted its feet
very high and set them down very gently  ransom was reminded alternately
of a cat stalking  a strutting barn-door fowl  and a high-stepping
carriage horse  but the movement was not really like that of any
terrestrial animal  for the passenger it was surprisingly comfortable  in
a few minutes he had lost all sense of what was dizzying or unnatural in
his position  instead  ludicrous and even tender associations came
crowding into his mind  it was like riding an elephant at the zoo in
boyhood—like riding on his fathers back at a still earlier age  it was
fun  they seemed to be doing between six and seven miles an hour  the
cold  though severe  was endurable  and thanks to the oxygen he had
little difficulty with his breathing 

the landscape which he saw from his high  swaying post of observation was
a solemn one  the  handramit  was nowhere to be seen  on each side of the
shallow gully in which they were walking  a world of naked  faintly
greenish rock  interrupted with wide patches of red  extended to the
horizon  the heaven  darkest blue where the rock met it  was almost black
at the zenith  and looking in any direction where sunlight did not blind
him  he could see the stars  he learned from the  sorn  that he was right
in thinking they were near the limits of the breathable  already on the
mountain fringe that borders the  harandra  and walls the  handramit   or
in the narrow depression along which their road led them  the air is of
himalayan rarity  ill breathing for a  hross   and a few hundred feet
higher  on the  harandra  proper  the true surface of the planet  it
admits no life  hence the brightness through which they walked was almost
that of heaven—celestial light hardly at all tempered with an atmospheric
veil 

the shadow of the  sorn   with ransoms shadow on its shoulder  moved
over the uneven rock unnaturally distinct like the shadow of a tree
before the headlights of a car  and the rock beyond the shadow hurt his
eyes  the remote horizon seemed but an arms length away  the fissures
and moulding of distant slopes were clear as the background of a
primitive picture made before men learned perspective  he was on the very
frontier of that heaven he had known in the space-ship  and rays that the
air-enveloped worlds cannot taste were once more at work upon his body 
he felt the old lift of the heart  the soaring solemnity  the sense  at
once sober and ecstatic  of life and power offered in unasked and
unmeasured abundance  if there had been air enough in his lungs he would
have laughed aloud  and now  even in the immediate landscape  beauty was
drawing near  over the edge of the valley  as if it had frothed down from
the true  harandra   came great curves of the rose-tinted  cumular stuff
which he had seen so often from a distance  now on a nearer view they
appeared hard as stone in substance  but puffed above and stalked beneath
like vegetation  his original simile of giant cauliflower turned out to
be surprisingly correct—stone cauliflowers the size of cathedrals and the
colour of pale rose  he asked the  sorn  what it was 

it is the old forests of malacandra  said augray  once there was air
on the  harandra  and it was warm  to this day  if you could get up there
and live  you would see it all covered with the bones of ancient
creatures  it was once full of life and noise  it was then these forests
grew  and in and out among their stalks went a people that have vanished
from the world these many thousand years  they were covered not with fur
but with a coat like mine  they did not go in the water swimming or on
the ground walking  they glided in the air on broad flat limbs which kept
them up  it is said they were great singers  and in those days the red
forests echoed with their music  now the forests have become stone and
only  eldila  can go among them 

we still have such creatures in our world  said ransom  we call them
birds  where was oyarsa when all this happened to the  harandra  

where he is now 

and he could not prevent it 

i do not know  but a world is not made to last for ever  much less a
race  that is not maleldils way 

as they proceeded the petrified forests grew more numerous  and often for
half an hour at a time the whole horizon of the lifeless  almost airless 
waste blushed like an english garden in summer  they passed many caves
where  as augray told him   sorns  lived  sometimes a high cliff would be
perforated with countless holes to the very top and unidentifiable noises
came hollowly from within  work was in progress  said the  sorn   but
of what kind it could not make him understand  its vocabulary was very
different from that of the  hrossa   nowhere did he see anything like a
village or city of  sorns   who were apparently solitary not social
creatures  once or twice a long pallid face would show from a cavern
mouth and exchange a horn-like greeting with the travellers  but for the
most part the long valley  the rock-street of the silent people  was
still and empty as the  harandra  itself 

only towards afternoon  as they were about to descend into a dip of the
road  they met three  sorns  together coming towards them down the
opposite slope  they seemed to ransom to be rather skating than walking 
the lightness of their world and the perfect poise of their bodies
allowed them to lean forward at right angles to the slope  and they came
swiftly down like full-rigged ships before a fair wind  the grace of
their movement  their lofty stature  and the softened glancing of the
sunlight on their feathery sides  effected a final transformation in
ransoms feelings towards their race  ogres he had called them when
they first met his eyes as he struggled in the grip of weston and devine 
titans or angels he now thought would have been a better word  even
the faces  it seemed to him  he had not then seen aright  he had thought
them spectral when they were only august  and his first human reaction to
their lengthened severity of line and profound stillness of expression
now appeared to him not so much cowardly as vulgar  so might parmenides
or confucius look to the eyes of a cockney schoolboy  the great white
creatures sailed towards ransom and augray and dipped like trees and
passed 

in spite of the cold—which made him often dismount and take a spell on
foot—he did not wish for the end of the journey  but augray had his own
plans and halted for the night long before sundown at the home of an
older  sorn   ransom saw well enough that he was brought there to be
shown to a great scientist  the cave  or  to speak more correctly  the
system of excavations  was large and many-chambered  and contained a
multitude of things that he did not understand  he was specially
interested in a collection of rolls  seemingly of skin  covered with
characters  which were clearly books  but he gathered that books were few
in malacandra 

it is better to remember  said the  sorns  

when ransom asked if valuable secrets might not thus be lost  they
replied that oyarsa always remembered them and would bring them to light
if he thought fit 

the  hrossa  used to have many books of poetry  they added  but now
they have fewer  they say that the writing of books destroys poetry 

their host in these caverns was attended by a number of other  sorns  who
seemed to be in some way subordinate to him  ransom thought at first that
they were servants but decided later that they were pupils or assistants 

the evenings conversation was not such as would interest a terrestrial
reader  for the  sorns  had determined that ransom should not ask  but
answer  questions  their questioning was very different from the
rambling  imaginative inquiries of the  hrossa   they worked
systematically from the geology of earth to its present geography  and
thence in turn to flora  fauna  human history  languages  politics and
arts  when they found that ransom could tell them no more on a given
subject—and this happened pretty soon in most of their inquiries—they
dropped it at once and went on to the next  often they drew out of him
indirectly much more knowledge than he consciously possessed  apparently
working from a wide background of general science  a casual remark about
trees when ransom was trying to explain the manufacture of paper would
fill up for them a gap in his sketchy answers to their botanical
questions  his account of terrestrial navigation might illuminate
mineralogy  and his description of the steam-engine gave them a better
knowledge of terrestrial air and water than ransom had ever had  he had
decided from the outset that he would be quite frank  for he now felt
that it would be not  hnau   and also that it would be unavailing  to do
otherwise  they were astonished at what he had to tell them of human
history—of war  slavery and prostitution 

it is because they have no oyarsa  said one of the pupils 

it is because every one of them wants to be a little oyarsa himself 
said augray 

they cannot help it  said the old  sorn   there must be rule  yet how
can creatures rule themselves  beasts must be ruled by  hnau  and  hnau 
by  eldila  and  eldila  by maleldil  these creatures have no  eldila  
they are like one trying to lift himself by his own hair—or one trying to
see over a whole country when he is on a level with it—like a female
trying to beget young on herself 

two things about our world particularly stuck in their minds  one was the
extraordinary degree to which problems of lifting and carrying things
absorbed our energy  the other was the fact that we had only one kind of
 hnau   they thought this must have far-reaching effects in the narrowing
of sympathies and even of thought 

your thought must be at the mercy of your blood  said the old  sorn  
for you cannot compare it with thought that floats on a different
blood 

it was a tiring and very disagreeable conversation for ransom  but when
at last he lay down to sleep it was not of the human nakedness nor of his
own ignorance that he was thinking  he thought only of the old forests of
malacandra and of what it might mean to grow up seeing always so few
miles away a land of colour that could never be reached and had once been
inhabited 




                               seventeen


early next day ransom again took his seat on augrays shoulder  for more
than an hour they travelled through the same bright wilderness  far to
the north the sky was luminous with a cloud-like mass of dull red or
ochre  it was very large and drove furiously westward about ten miles
above the waste  ransom  who had yet seen no cloud in the malacandrian
sky  asked what it was  the  sorn  told him it was sand caught up from
the great northern deserts by the winds of that terrible country  it was
often thus carried  sometimes at a height of seventeen miles  to fall
again  perhaps in a  handramit   as a choking and blinding dust-storm 
the sight of it moving with menace in the naked sky served to remind
ransom that they were indeed on the  outside  of malacandra—no longer
dwelling in a world but crawling the surface of a strange planet  at last
the cloud seemed to drop and burst far on the western horizon  where a
glow  not unlike that of a conflagration  remained visible until a turn
of the valley hid all that region from his view 

the same turn opened a new prospect to his eyes  what lay before him
looked at first strangely like an earthly landscape—a landscape of grey
downland ridges rising and falling like waves of the sea  far beyond 
cliffs and spires of the familiar green rock rose against the dark blue
sky  a moment later he saw that what he had taken for downlands was but
the ridged and furrowed surface of a blue-grey valley mist—a mist which
would not appear a mist at all when they descended into the  handramit  
and already  as their road began descending  it was less visible and the
many-coloured pattern of the low country showed vaguely through it  the
descent grew quickly steeper  like the jagged teeth of a giant—a giant
with very bad teeth—the topmost peaks of the mountain wall down which
they must pass loomed up over the edge of their gully  the look of the
sky and the quality of the light were infinitesimally changed  a moment
later they stood on the edge of such a slope as by earthly standards
would rather be called a precipice  down and down this face  to where it
vanished in a purple blush of vegetation  ran their road  ransom refused
absolutely to make the descent on augrays shoulder  the  sorn   though
it did not fully understand his objection  stooped for him to dismount 
and proceeded  with that same skating and forward-sloping motion  to go
down before him  ransom followed  using gladly but stiffly his numb legs 

the beauty of this new  handramit  as it opened before him took his
breath away  it was wider than that in which he had hitherto lived and
right below him lay an almost circular lake—a sapphire twelve miles in
diameter set in a border of purple forest  amidst the lake there rose
like a low and gently sloping pyramid  or like a womans breast  an
island of pale red  smooth to the summit  and on the summit a grove of
such trees as man had never seen  their smooth columns had the gentle
swell of the noblest beech-trees  but these were taller than a cathedral
spire on earth  and at their tops  they broke rather into flower than
foliage  into golden flower bright as tulip  still as rock  and huge as
summer cloud  flowers indeed they were  not trees  and far down among
their roots he caught a pale hint of slab-like architecture  he knew
before his guide told him that this was meldilorn  he did not know what
he had expected  the old dreams which he had brought from earth of some
more than american complexity of offices or some engineers paradise of
vast machines had indeed been long laid aside  but he had not looked for
anything quite so classic  so virginal  as this bright grove—lying so
still  so secret  in its coloured valley  soaring with inimitable grace
so many hundred feet into the wintry sunlight  at every step of his
descent the comparative warmth of the valley came up to him more
deliciously  he looked above—the sky was turning to a paler blue  he
looked below—and sweet and faint the thin fragrance of the giant blooms
came up to him  distant crags were growing less sharp in outline  and
surfaces less bright  depth  dimness  softness and perspective were
returning to the landscape  the lip or edge of rock from which they had
started their descent was already far overhead  it seemed unlikely that
they had really come from there  he was breathing freely  his toes  so
long benumbed  could move delightfully inside his boots  he lifted the
ear-flaps of his cap and found his ears instantly filled with the sound
of falling water  and now he was treading on soft ground-weed over level
earth and the forest roof was above his head  they had conquered the
 harandra  and were on the threshold of meldilorn 

a short walk brought them into a kind of forest ride—a broad avenue
running straight as an arrow through the purple stems to where the vivid
blue of the lake danced at the end of it  there they found a gong and
hammer hung on a pillar of stone  these objects were all richly
decorated  and the gong and hammer were of a greenish blue metal which
ransom did not recognize  augray struck the gong  an excitement was
rising in ransoms mind which almost prevented him from examining as
coolly as he wished the ornamentation of the stone  it was partly
pictorial  partly pure decoration  what chiefly struck him was a certain
balance of packed and empty surfaces  pure line drawings  as bare as the
prehistoric pictures of reindeer on earth  alternated with patches of
design as close and intricate as norse or celtic jewellery  and then  as
you looked at it  these empty and crowded areas turned out to be
themselves arranged in larger designs  he was struck by the fact that the
pictorial work was not confined to the emptier spaces  quite often large
arabesques included as a subordinate detail intricate pictures  elsewhere
the opposite plan had been followed—and this alternation  too  had a
rhythmical or patterned element in it  he was just beginning to find out
that the pictures  though stylized  were obviously intended to tell a
story  when augray interrupted him  a ship had put out from the island
shore of meldilorn 

as it came towards them ransoms heart warmed to see that it was paddled
by a  hross   the creature brought its boat up to the shore where they
were waiting  stared at ransom and then looked inquiringly at augray 

you may well wonder at this  nau   hrinha  said the  sorn   for you
have never seen anything like it  it is called ren-soom and has come
through heaven from thulcandra 

it is welcome  augray  said the  hross  politely  is it coming to
oyarsa 

he has sent for it 

and for you also  augray 

oyarsa has not called me  if you will take ren-soom over the water  i
will go back to my tower 

the  hross  indicated that ransom should enter the boat  he attempted to
express his thanks to the  sorn  and after a moments consideration
unstrapped his wrist-watch and offered it to him  it was the only thing
he had which seemed a suitable present for a  sorn   he had no difficulty
in making augray understand its purpose  but after examining it the giant
gave it back to him  a little reluctantly  and said 

this gift ought to be given to a  pfifltrigg   it rejoices my heart  but
they would make more of it  you are likely to meet some of the busy
people in meldilorn  give it to them  as for its use  do your people not
know except by looking at this thing how much of the day has worn 

i believe there are beasts that have a sort of knowledge of that  said
ransom  but our  hnau  have lost it 

after this  his farewells to the  sorn  were made and he embarked  to be
once more in a boat and with a  hross   to feel the warmth of water on
his face and to see a blue sky above him  was almost like coming home  he
took off his cap and leaned back luxuriously in the bows  plying his
escort with questions  he learned that the  hrossa  were not specially
concerned with the service of oyarsa  as he had surmised from finding a
 hross  in charge of the ferry  all three species of  hnau  served him in
their various capacities  and the ferry was naturally entrusted to those
who understood boats  he learned that his own procedure on arriving in
meldilorn must be to go where he liked and do what he pleased until
oyarsa called for him  it might be an hour or several days before this
happened  he would find huts near the landing-place where he could sleep
if necessary and where food would be given him  in return he related as
much as he could make intelligible of his own world and his journey from
it  and he warned the  hross  of the dangerous bent men who had brought
him and who were still at large on malacandra  as he did so  it occurred
to him that he had not made this sufficiently clear to augray  but he
consoled himself with the reflection that weston and devine seemed to
have already some liaison with the  sorns  and that they would not be
likely to molest things so large and so comparatively man-like  at any
rate  not yet  about devines ultimate designs he had no illusions  all
he could do was to make a clean breast of them to oyarsa  and now the
ship touched land 

ransom rose  while the  hross  was making fast  and looked about him 
close to the little harbour which they had entered  and to the left  were
low buildings of stone—the first he had seen in malacandra—and fires were
burning  there  the  hross  told him  he could find food and shelter  for
the rest the island seemed desolate  and its smooth slopes empty up to
the grove that crowned them  where  again  he saw stonework  but this
appeared to be neither temple nor house in the human sense  but a broad
avenue of monoliths—a much larger stonehenge  stately  empty and
vanishing over the crest of the hill into the pale shadow of the
flower-trunks  all was solitude  but as he gazed upon it he seemed to
hear  against the background of morning silence  a faint  continual
agitation of silvery sound—hardly a sound at all  if you attended to it 
and yet impossible to ignore 

the island is all full of  eldila   said the  hross  in a hushed voice 

he went ashore  as though half expecting some obstacle  he took a few
hesitant paces forward and stopped  and then went on again in the same
fashion 

though the ground-weed was unusually soft and rich and his feet made no
noise upon it  he felt an impulse to walk on tiptoes  all his movements
became gentle and sedate  the width of water about this island made the
air warmer than any he had yet breathed in malacandra  the climate was
almost that of a warm earthly day in late september—a day that is warm
but with a hint of frost to come  the sense of awe which was increasing
upon him deterred him from approaching the crown of the hill  the grove
and the avenue of standing stones 

he ceased ascending about half-way up the hill and began walking to his
right  keeping a constant distance from the shore  he said to himself
that he was having a look at the island  but his feeling was rather that
the island was having a look at him  this was greatly increased by a
discovery he made after he had been walking for about an hour  and which
he ever afterwards found great difficulty in describing  in the most
abstract terms it might be summed up by saying that the surface of the
island was subject to tiny variations of light and shade which no change
in the sky accounted for  if the air had not been calm and the
ground-weed too short and firm to move in the wind  he would have said
that a faint breeze was playing with it  and working such slight
alterations in the shading as it does in a corn-field on the earth  like
the silvery noises in the air  these footsteps of light were shy of
observation  where he looked hardest they were least to be seen  on the
edges of his field of vision they came crowding as though a complex
arrangement of them were there in progress  to attend to any one of them
was to make it invisible  and the minute brightness seemed often to have
just left the spot where his eyes fell  he had no doubt that he was
seeing—as much as he ever would see—the  eldila   the sensation it
produced in him was curious  it was not exactly uncanny  not as if he
were surrounded by ghosts  it was not even as if he were being spied
upon  he had rather the sense of being looked at by things that had a
right to look  his feeling was less than fear  it had in it something of
embarrassment  something of shyness  something of submission  and it was
profoundly uneasy 

he felt tired and thought that in this favoured land it would be warm
enough to rest out of doors  he sat down  the softness of the weed  the
warmth and the sweet smell which pervaded the whole island  reminded him
of earth and gardens in summer  he closed his eyes for a moment  then he
opened them again and noticed buildings below him  and over the lake he
saw a boat approaching  recognition suddenly came to him  that was the
ferry  and these buildings were the guest-house beside the harbour  he
had walked all round the island  a certain disappointment succeeded this
discovery  he was beginning to feel hungry  perhaps it would be a good
plan to go down and ask for some food  at any rate it would pass the
time 

but he did not do so  when he rose and looked more closely at the
guest-house he saw a considerable stir of creatures about it  and while
he watched he saw that a full load of passengers was landing from the
ferry-boat  in the lake he saw some moving objects which he did not at
first identify but which turned out to be  sorns  up to their middles in
the water and obviously wading to meldilorn from the mainland  there were
about ten of them  for some reason or other the island was receiving an
influx of visitors  he no longer supposed that any harm would be done to
him if he went down and mixed in the crowd  but he felt a reluctance to
do so  the situation brought vividly back to his mind his experience as a
new boy at school—new boys came a day early—hanging about and watching
the arrival of the old hands  in the end he decided not to go down  he
cut and ate some of the ground-weed and dozed for a little 

in the afternoon  when it grew colder  he resumed his walking  other
 hnau  were roaming about the island by this time  he saw  sorns 
chiefly  but this was because their height made them conspicuous  there
was hardly any noise  his reluctance to meet these fellow-wanderers  who
seemed to confine themselves to the coast of the island  drove him half
consciously upwards and inwards  he found himself at last on the fringes
of the grove and looking straight up the monolithic avenue  he had
intended  for no very clearly defined reason  not to enter it  but he
fell to studying the stone nearest to him  which was richly sculptured on
all its four sides  and after that curiosity led him on from stone to
stone 

the pictures were very puzzling  side by side with representations of
 sorns  and  hrossa  and what he supposed to be  pfifltriggi  there
occurred again and again an upright wavy figure with only the suggestion
of a face  and with wings  the wings were perfectly recognizable  and
this puzzled him very much  could it be that the traditions of
malacandrian art went back to that earlier geological and biological era
when  as augray had told him  there was life  including bird-life  on the
 harandra   the answer of the stones seemed to be yes  he saw pictures of
the old red forests with unmistakable birds flying among them  and many
other creatures that he did not know  on another stone many of these were
represented lying dead  and a fantastic  hnakra -like figure  presumably
symbolizing the cold  was depicted in the sky above them shooting at them
with darts  creatures still alive were crowding round the winged  wavy
figure  which he took to be oyarsa  pictured as a winged flame  on the
next stone oyarsa appeared  followed by many creatures  and apparently
making a furrow with some pointed instrument  another picture showed the
furrow being enlarged by  pfifltriggi  with digging tools   sorns  were
piling the earth up in pinnacles on each side  and  hrossa  seemed to be
making water channels  ransom wondered whether this were a mythical
account of the making of  handramits  or whether they were conceivably
artificial in fact 

many of the pictures he could make nothing of  one that particularly
puzzled him showed at the bottom a segment of a circle  behind and above
which rose three-quarters of a disk divided into concentric rings  he
thought it was a picture of the sun rising behind a hill  certainly the
segment at the bottom was full of malacandrian scenes—oyarsa in
meldilorn   sorns  on the mountain edge of the  harandra   and many other
things both familiar to him and strange  he turned from it to examine the
disk which rose behind it  it was not the sun  the sun was there 
unmistakably  at the centre of the disk  round this the concentric
circles revolved  in the first and smallest of these was pictured a
little ball  on which rode a winged figure something like oyarsa  but
holding what appeared to be a trumpet  in the next  a similar ball
carried another of the flaming figures  this one  instead of even the
suggested face  had two bulges which after long inspection he decided
were meant to be the udders or breasts of a female mammal  by this time
he was quite sure that he was looking at a picture of the solar system 
the first ball was mercury  the second venus—and what an extraordinary
coincidence  thought ransom  that their mythology  like ours 
associates some idea of the female with venus  the problem would have
occupied him longer if a natural curiosity had not drawn his eyes on to
the next ball which must represent the earth  when he saw it  his whole
mind stood still for a moment  the ball was there  but where the
flame-like figure should have been  a deep depression of irregular shape
had been cut as if to erase it  once  then—but his speculations faltered
and became silent before a series of unknowns  he looked at the next
circle  here there was no ball  instead  the bottom of this circle
touched the top of the big segment filled with malacandrian scenes  so
that malacandra at this point touched the solar system and came out of it
in perspective towards the spectator  now that his mind had grasped the
design  he was astonished at the vividness of it all  he stood back and
drew a deep breath preparatory to tackling some of the mysteries in which
he was engulfed  malacandra  then  was mars  the earth—but at this point
a sound of tapping or hammering  which had been going on for some time
without gaining admission to his consciousness  became too insistent to
be ignored  some creature  and certainly not an  eldil   was at work 
close to him  a little startled—for he had been deep in thought—he turned
round  there was nothing to be seen  he shouted out  idiotically  in
english 

whos there 

the tapping instantly stopped and a remarkable face appeared from behind
a neighbouring monolith 

it was hairless like a mans or a  sorns   it was long and pointed like
a shrews  yellow and shabby-looking  and so low in the forehead that but
for the heavy development of the head at the back and behind the ears
 like a bag-wig  it could not have been that of an intelligent creature 
a moment later the whole of the thing came into view with a startling
jump  ransom guessed that it was a  pfifltrigg —and was glad that he had
not met one of this third race on his first arrival in malacandra  it was
much more insect-like or reptilian than anything he had yet seen  its
build was distinctly that of a frog  and at first ransom thought it was
resting  frog-like  on its hands  then he noticed that that part of its
fore-limbs on which it was supported was really  in human terms  rather
an elbow than a hand  it was broad and padded and clearly made to be
walked on  but upwards from it  at an angle of about forty-five degrees 
went the true fore-arms—thin  strong forearms  ending in enormous 
sensitive  many-fingered hands  he realized that for all manual work from
mining to cutting cameos this creature had the advantage of being able to
work with its full strength from a supported elbow  the insect-like
effect was due to the speed and jerkiness of its movements and to the
fact that it could swivel its head almost all the way round like a
mantis  and it was increased by a kind of dry  rasping  jingling quality
in the noise of its moving  it was rather like a grasshopper  rather like
one of arthur rackhams dwarfs  rather like a frog  and rather like a
little  old taxidermist whom ransom knew in london 

i come from another world  began ransom 

i know  i know  said the creature in a quick  twittering  rather
impatient voice  come here  behind the stone  this way  this way 
oyarsas orders  very busy  must begin at once  stand there 

ransom found himself on the other side of the monolith  staring at a
picture which was still in process of completion  the ground was
liberally strewn with chips and the air was full of dust 

there  said the creature  stand still  dont look at me  look over
there 

for a moment ransom did not quite understand what was expected of him 
then  as he saw the  pfifltrigg  glancing to and fro at him and at the
stone with the unmistakable glance of artist from model to work which is
the same in all worlds  he realized and almost laughed  he was standing
for his portrait  from his position he could see that the creature was
cutting the stone as if it were cheese and the swiftness of its movements
almost baffled his eyes  but he could get no impression of the work done 
though he could study the  pfifltrigg   he saw that the jingling and
metallic noise was due to the number of small instruments which it
carried about its body  sometimes  with an exclamation of annoyance  it
would throw down the tool it was working with and select one of these 
but the majority of those in immediate use it kept in its mouth  he
realized also that this was an animal artificially clothed like himself 
in some bright scaly substance which appeared richly decorated though
coated in dust  it had folds of furry clothing about its throat like a
comforter  and its eyes were protected by dark bulging goggles  rings and
chains of a bright metal—not gold  he thought—adorned its limbs and neck 
all the time it was working it kept up a sort of hissing whisper to
itself  and when it was excited—which it usually was—the end of its nose
wrinkled like a rabbits  at last it gave another startling leap  landed
about ten yards away from its work  and said 

yes  yes  not so good as i hoped  do better another time  leave it now 
come and see yourself 

ransom obeyed  he saw a picture of the planets  not now arranged to make
a map of the solar system  but advancing in a single procession towards
the spectator  and all  save one  bearing its fiery charioteer  below lay
malacandra and there  to his surprise  was a very tolerable picture of
the space-ship  beside it stood three figures for all of which ransom had
apparently been the model  he recoiled from them in disgust  even
allowing for the strangeness of the subject from a malacandrian point of
view and for the stylization of their art  still  he thought  the
creature might have made a better attempt at the human form than these
stock-like dummies  almost as thick as they were tall  and sprouting
about the head and neck into something that looked like fungus 

he hedged  i expect it is like me as i look to your people  he said 
it is not how they would draw me in my own world 

no  said the  pfifltrigg   i do not mean it to be too like  too like 
and they will not believe it—those who are born after  he added a good
deal more which was difficult to understand  but while he was speaking it
dawned upon ransom that the odious figures were intended as an
 idealization  of humanity  conversation languished for a little  to
change the subject ransom asked a question which had been in his mind for
some time 

i cannot understand  he said  how you and the  sorns  and the  hrossa 
all come to speak the same speech  for your tongues and teeth and throats
must be very different 

you are right  said the creature  once we all had different speeches
and we still have at home  but everyone has learned the speech of the
 hrossa  

why is that  said ransom  still thinking in terms of terrestrial
history  did the  hrossa  once rule the others 

i do not understand  they are our great speakers and singers  they have
more words and better  no one learns the speech of my people  for what we
have to say is said in stone and suns blood and stars milk and all can
see them  no one learns the  sorns  speech  for you can change their
knowledge into any words and it is still the same  you cannot do that
with the songs of the  hrossa   their tongue goes all over malacandra  i
speak it to you because you are a stranger  i would speak it to a  sorn  
but we have our old tongues at home  you can see it in the names  the
 sorns  have big-sounding names like augray and arkal and belmo and
falmay  the  hrossa  have furry names like hnoh and hnihi and hyoi and
hlithnahi 

the best poetry  then  comes in the roughest speech 

perhaps  said the  pfifltrigg   as the best pictures are made in the
hardest stone  but my people have names like kalakaperi and parakataru
and tafalakeruf  i am called kanakaberaka 

ransom told it his name 

in our country  said kanakaberaka  it is not like this  we are not
pinched in a narrow  handramit   there are the true forests  the green
shadows  the deep mines  it is warm  it does not blaze with light like
this  and it is not silent like this  i could put you in a place there in
the forests where you could see a hundred fires at once and hear a
hundred hammers  i wish you had come to our country  we do not live in
holes like the  sorns  nor in bundles of weed like the  hrossa   i could
show you houses with a hundred pillars  one of suns blood and the next
of stars milk  all the way       and all the world painted on the
walls 

how do you rule yourselves  asked ransom  those who are digging in the
mines—do they like it as much as those who paint the walls 

all keep the mines open  it is a work to be shared  but each digs for
himself the thing he wants for his work  what else would he do 

it is not so with us 

then you must make very bent work  how would a maker understand working
in suns blood unless he went into the home of suns blood himself and
knew one kind from another and lived with it for days out of the light of
the sky till it was in his blood and his heart  as if he thought it and
ate it and spat it 

with us it lies very deep and hard to get and those who dig it must
spend their whole lives on the skill 

and they love it 

i think not       i do not know  they are kept at it because they are
given no food if they stop 

kanakaberaka wrinkled his nose  then there is not food in plenty on your
world 

i do not know  said ransom  i have often wished to know the answer to
that question but no one can tell me  does no one keep your people at
their work  kanakaberaka 

our females  said the  pfifltrigg  with a piping noise which was
apparently his equivalent for a laugh 

are your females of more account among you than those of the other
 hnau  among them 

very greatly  the  sorns  make least account of females and we make
most 




                                eighteen


that night ransom slept in the guest-house  which was a real house built
by  pfifltriggi  and richly decorated  his pleasure at finding himself 
in this respect  under more human conditions was qualified by the
discomfort which  despite his reason  he could not help feeling in the
presence  at close quarters  of so many malacandrian creatures  all three
species were represented  they seemed to have no uneasy feelings towards
each other  though there were some differences of the kind that occur in
a railway carriage on earth—the  sorns  finding the house too hot and the
 pfifltriggi  finding it too cold  he learned more of malacandrian humour
and of the noises that expressed it in this one night than he had learned
during the whole of his life on the strange planet hitherto  indeed 
nearly all malacandrian conversations in which he had yet taken part had
been grave  apparently the comic spirit arose chiefly from the meeting of
the different kinds of  hnau   the jokes of all three were equally
incomprehensible to him  he thought he could see differences in kind—as
that the  sorns  seldom got beyond irony  while the  hrossa  were
extravagant and fantastic  and the  pfifltriggi  were sharp and excelled
in abuse—but even when he understood all the words he could not see the
points  he went early to bed 

it was at the time of early morning  when men on earth go out to milk the
cows  that ransom was wakened  at first he did not know what had roused
him  the chamber in which he lay was silent  empty and nearly dark  he
was preparing himself to sleep again when a high-pitched voice close
beside him said  oyarsa sends for you  he sat up  staring about him 
there was no one there  and the voice repeated  oyarsa sends for you 
the confusion of sleep was now clearing in his head  and he recognized
that there was an  eldil  in the room  he felt no conscious fear  but
while he rose obediently and put on such of his clothes as he had laid
aside he found that his heart was beating rather fast  he was thinking
less of the invisible creature in the room than of the interview that lay
before him  his old terrors of meeting some monster or idol had quite
left him  he felt nervous as he remembered feeling on the morning of an
examination when he was an undergraduate  more than anything in the world
he would have liked a cup of good tea 

the guest-house was empty  he went out  the bluish smoke was rising from
the lake and the sky was bright behind the jagged eastern wall of the
canyon  it was a few minutes before sunrise  the air was still very cold 
the ground-weed drenched with dew  and there was something puzzling about
the whole scene which he presently identified with the silence  the
 eldil  voices in the air had ceased and so had the shifting network of
small lights and shades  without being told  he knew that it was his
business to go up to the crown of the island and the grove  as he
approached them he saw with a certain sinking of heart that the
monolithic avenue was full of malacandrian creatures  and all silent 
they were in two lines  one on each side  and all squatting or sitting in
the various fashions suitable to their anatomies  he walked on slowly and
doubtfully  not daring to stop  and ran the gauntlet of all those inhuman
and unblinking eyes  when he had come to the very summit  at the middle
of the avenue where the biggest of the stones rose  he stopped—he never
could remember afterwards whether an  eldil  voice had told him to do so
or whether it was an intuition of his own  he did not sit down  for the
earth was too cold and wet and he was not sure if it would be decorous 
he simply stood—motionless like a man on parade  all the creatures were
looking at him and there was no noise anywhere 

he perceived  gradually  that the place was full of  eldila   the lights 
or suggestions of light  which yesterday had been scattered over the
island  were now all congregated in this one spot  and were all
stationary or very faintly moving  the sun had risen by now  and still no
one spoke  as he looked up to see the first  pale sunlight upon the
monoliths  he became conscious that the air above him was full of a far
greater complexity of light than the sunrise could explain  and light of
a different kind   eldil -light  the sky  no less than the earth  was
full of them  the visible malacandrians were but the smallest part of the
silent consistory which surrounded him  he might  when the time came  be
pleading his cause before thousands or before millions  rank behind rank
about him  and rank above rank over his head  the creatures that had
never yet seen man and whom man could not see  were waiting for his trial
to begin  he licked his lips  which were quite dry  and wondered if he
would be able to speak when speech was demanded of him  then it occurred
to him that perhaps this—this waiting and being looked at— was  the
trial  perhaps even now he was unconsciously telling them all they wished
to know  but afterwards—a long time afterwards—there was a noise of
movement  every visible creature in the grove had risen to its feet and
was standing  more hushed than ever  with its head bowed  and ransom saw
 if it could be called seeing  that oyarsa was coming up between the long
lines of sculptured stones  partly he knew it from the faces of the
malacandrians as their lord passed them  partly he saw—he could not deny
that he saw—oyarsa himself  he never could say what it was like  the
merest whisper of light—no  less than that  the smallest diminution of
shadow—was travelling along the uneven surface of the ground-weed  or
rather some difference in the look of the ground  too slight to be named
in the language of the five senses  moved slowly towards him  like a
silence spreading over a room full of people  like an infinitesimal
coolness on a sultry day  like a passing memory of some long-forgotten
sound or scent  like all that is stillest and smallest and most hard to
seize in nature  oyarsa passed between his subjects and drew near and
came to rest  not ten yards away from ransom in the centre of meldilorn 
ransom felt a tingling of his blood and a pricking on his fingers as if
lightning were near him  and his heart and body seemed to him to be made
of water 

oyarsa spoke—a more unhuman voice than ransom had yet heard  sweet and
seemingly remote  an unshaken voice  a voice  as one of the  hrossa 
afterwards said to ransom  with no blood in it  light is instead of
blood for them  the words were not alarming 

what are you so afraid of  ransom of thulcandra  it said 

of you  oyarsa  because you are unlike me and i cannot see you 

those are not great reasons  said the voice  you are also unlike me 
and  though i see you  i see you very faintly  but do not think we are
utterly unlike  we are both copies of maleldil  these are not the real
reasons 

ransom said nothing 

you began to be afraid of me before you set foot in my world  and you
have spent all your time since then in flying from me  my servants saw
your fear when you were in your ship in heaven  they saw that your own
kind treated you ill  though they could not understand their speech  then
to deliver you out of the hands of those two i stirred up a  hnakra  to
try if you would come to me of your own will  but you hid among the
 hrossa   and though they told you to come to me  you would not  after
that i sent my  eldil  to fetch you  but still you would not come  and in
the end your own kind have chased you to me  and  hnaus  blood has been
shed 

i do not understand  oyarsa  do you mean that it was you who sent for me
from thulcandra 

yes  did not the other two tell you this  and why did you come with them
unless you meant to obey my call  my servants could not understand their
talk to you when your ship was in heaven 

your servants       i cannot understand  said ransom 

ask freely  said the voice 

have you servants out in the heavens 

where else  there is nowhere else 

but you  oyarsa  are here on malacandra  as i am 

but malacandra  like all worlds  floats in heaven  and i am not “here”
altogether as you are  ransom of thulcandra  creatures of your kind must
drop out of heaven into a world  for us the worlds are places in heaven 
but do not try to understand this now  it is enough to know that i and my
servants are even now in heaven  they were around you in the sky-ship no
less than they are around you here 

then you knew of our journey before we left thulcandra 

no  thulcandra is the world we do not know  it alone is outside the
heaven  and no message comes from it 

ransom was silent  but oyarsa answered his unspoken questions 

it was not always so  once we knew the oyarsa of your world—he was
brighter and greater than i—and then we did not call it thulcandra  it is
the longest of all stories and the bitterest  he became bent  that was
before any life came on your world  those were the bent years of which we
still speak in the heavens  when he was not yet bound to thulcandra but
free like us  it was in his mind to spoil other worlds besides his own 
he smote your moon with his left hand and with his right he brought the
cold death on my  harandra  before its time  if by my arm maleldil had
not opened the  handramits  and let out the hot springs  my world would
have been unpeopled  we did not leave him so at large for long  there was
great war  and we drove him back out of the heavens and bound him in the
air of his own world as maleldil taught us  there doubtless he lies to
this hour  and we know no more of that planet  it is silent  we think
that maleldil would not give it up utterly to the bent one  and there are
stories among us that he has taken strange counsel and dared terrible
things  wrestling with the bent one in thulcandra  but of this we know
less than you  it is a thing we desire to look into 

it was some time before ransom spoke again and oyarsa respected his
silence  when he had collected himself he said 

after this story  oyarsa  i may tell you that our world is very bent 
the two who brought me knew nothing of you  but only that the  sorns  had
asked for me  they thought you were a false  eldil   i think  there are
false  eldila  in the wild parts of our world  men kill other men before
them—they think the  eldil  drinks blood  they thought the  sorns  wanted
me for this or for some other evil  they brought me by force  i was in
terrible fear  the tellers of tales in our world make us think that if
there is any life beyond our own air  it is evil 

i understand  said the voice  and this explains things that i have
wondered at  as soon as your journey had passed your own air and entered
heaven  my servants told me that you seemed to be coming unwillingly and
that the others had secrets from you  i did not think any creature could
be so bent as to bring another of its own kind here by force 

they did not know what you wanted me for  oyarsa  nor do i know yet 

i will tell you  two years ago—and that is about four of your years—this
ship entered the heavens from your world  we followed its journey all the
way hither and  eldila  were with it as it sailed over the  harandra  
and when at last it came to rest in the  handramit  more than half my
servants were standing round it to see the strangers come out  all beasts
we kept back from the place  and no  hnau  yet knew of it  when the
strangers had walked to and fro on malacandra and made themselves a hut
and their fear of a new world ought to have worn off  i sent certain
 sorns  to show themselves and to teach the strangers our language  i
chose  sorns  because they are most like your people in form  the
thulcandrians feared the  sorns  and were very unteachable  the  sorns 
went to them many times and taught them a little  they reported to me
that the thulcandrians were taking suns blood wherever they could find
it in the streams  when i could make nothing of them by report  i told
the  sorns  to bring them to me  not by force but courteously  they would
not come  i asked for one of them  but not even one of them would come 
it would have been easy to take them  but though we saw they were stupid
we did not know yet how bent they were  and i did not wish to stretch my
authority beyond the creatures of my own world  i told the  sorns  to
treat them like cubs  to tell them that they would be allowed to pick up
no more of the suns blood until one of their race came to me  when they
were told this they stuffed as much as they could into the sky-ship and
went back to their own world  we wondered at this  but now it is plain 
they thought i wanted one of your race to eat and went to fetch one  if
they had come a few miles to see me i would have received them
honourably  now they have twice gone a voyage of millions of miles for
nothing and will appear before me none the less  and you also  ransom of
thulcandra  you have taken many vain troubles to avoid standing where you
stand now 

that is true  oyarsa  bent creatures are full of fears  but i am here
now and ready to know your will with me 

two things i wanted to ask of your race  first i must know why you come
here—so much is my duty to my world  and secondly i wish to hear of
thulcandra and of maleldils strange wars there with the bent one  for
that  as i have said  is a thing we desire to look into 

for the first question  oyarsa  i have come here because i was brought 
of the others  one cares for nothing but the suns blood  because in our
world he can exchange it for many pleasures and powers  but the other
means evil to you  i think he would destroy all your people to make room
for our people  and then he would do the same with other worlds again  he
wants our race to last for always  i think  and he hopes they will leap
from world to world       always going to a new sun when an old one dies
      or something like that 

is he wounded in his brain 

i do not know  perhaps i do not describe his thoughts right  he is more
learned than i 

does he think he could go to the great worlds  does he think maleldil
wants a race to live for ever 

he does not know there is any maleldil  but what is certain  oyarsa  is
that he means evil to your world  our kind must not be allowed to come
here again  if you can prevent it only by killing all three of us  i am
content 

if you were my own people i would kill them now  ransom  and you soon 
for they are bent beyond hope  and you  when you have grown a little
braver  will be ready to go to maleldil  but my authority is over my own
world  it is a terrible thing to kill someone elses  hnau   it will not
be necessary 

they are strong  oyarsa  and they can throw death many miles and can
blow killing airs at their enemies 

the least of my servants could touch their ship before it reached
malacandra  while it was in the heaven  and make it a body of different
movements—for you  no body at all  be sure that no one of your race will
come into my world again unless i call him  but enough of this  now tell
me of thulcandra  tell me all  we know nothing since the day when the
bent one sank out of heaven into the air of your world  wounded in the
very light of his light  but why have you become afraid again 

i am afraid of the lengths of time  oyarsa       or perhaps i do not
understand  did you not say this happened before there was life on
thulcandra 

yes 

and you  oyarsa  you have lived       and that picture on the stone
where the cold is killing them on the  harandra   is that a picture of
something that was before my world began 

i see you are  hnau  after all  said the voice  doubtless no stone
that faced the air then would be a stone now  the picture has begun to
crumble away and been copied again more times than there are  eldila  in
the air above us  but it was copied right  in that way you are seeing a
picture that was finished when your world was still half-made  but do not
think of these things  my people have a law never to speak much of sizes
or numbers to you others  not even to  sorns   you do not understand  and
it makes you do reverence to nothings and pass by what is really great 
rather tell me what maleldil has done in thulcandra 

according to our traditions—— ransom was beginning  when an unexpected
disturbance broke in upon the solemn stillness of the assembly  a large
party  almost a procession  was approaching the grove from the direction
of the ferry  it consisted entirely  so far as he could see  of  hrossa  
and they appeared to be carrying something 




                                nineteen


as the procession drew nearer ransom saw that the foremost  hrossa  were
supporting three long and narrow burdens  they carried them on their
heads  four  hrossa  to each  after these came a number of others armed
with harpoons and apparently guarding two creatures which he did not
recognize  the light was behind them as they entered between the two
farthest monoliths  they were much shorter than any animal he had yet
seen on malacandra  and he gathered that they were bipeds  though the
lower limbs were so thick and sausage-like that he hesitated to call them
legs  the bodies were a little narrower at the top than at the bottom so
as to be very slightly pear-shaped  and the heads were neither round like
those of  hrossa  nor long like those of  sorns   but almost square  they
stumped along on narrow  heavy-looking feet which they seemed to press
into the ground with unnecessary violence  and now their faces were
becoming visible as masses of lumped and puckered flesh of variegated
colour fringed in some bristly  dark substance        suddenly  with an
indescribable change of feeling  he realized that he was looking at men 
the two prisoners were weston and devine and he  for one privileged
moment  had seen the human form with almost malacandrian eyes 

the leaders of the procession had now advanced to within a few yards of
oyarsa and laid down their burdens  these  he now saw  were three dead
 hrossa  laid on biers of some unknown metal  they were on their backs
and their eyes  not closed as we close the eyes of human dead  stared
disconcertingly up at the far-off golden canopy of the grove  one of them
he took to be hyoi  and it was certainly hyois brother  hyahi  who now
came forward  and after an obeisance to oyarsa began to speak 

ransom at first did not hear what he was saying  for his attention was
concentrated on weston and devine  they were weaponless and vigilantly
guarded by the armed  hrossa  about them  both of them  like ransom
himself  had let their beards grow ever since they landed on malacandra 
and both were pale and travel-stained  weston was standing with folded
arms  and his face wore a fixed  even an elaborate  expression of
desperation  devine  with his hands in his pockets  seemed to be in a
state of furious sulks  both clearly thought that they had good reason to
fear  though neither was by any means lacking in courage  surrounded by
their guards as they were  and intent on the scene before them  they had
not noticed ransom 

he became aware of what hyois brother was saying 

for the death of these two  oyarsa  i do not so much complain  for when
we fell upon the  hmāna  by night they were in terror  you may say it was
as a hunt and these two were killed as they might have been by a
 hnakra   but hyoi they hit from afar with a cowards weapon when he had
done nothing to frighten them  and now he lies there  and i do not say it
because he was my brother  but all the  handramit  knows it  and he was a
 hnakrapunt  and a great poet and the loss of him is heavy 

the voice of oyarsa spoke for the first time to the two men 

why have you killed my  hnau   it said 

weston and devine looked anxiously about them to identify the speaker 

god  exclaimed devine in english  dont tell me theyve got a
loud-speaker 

ventriloquism  replied weston in a husky whisper  quite common among
savages  the witch-doctor or medicine-man pretends to go into a trance
and he does it  the thing to do is to identify the medicine-man and
address your remarks to  him  wherever the voice seems to come from  it
shatters his nerve and shows youve seen through him  do you see any of
the brutes in a trance  by jove—ive spotted him 

due credit must be given to weston for his powers of observation  he had
picked out the only creature in the assembly which was not standing in an
attitude of reverence and attention  this was an elderly  hross  close
beside him  it was squatting  and its eyes were shut  taking a step
towards it  he struck a defiant attitude and exclaimed in a loud voice
 his knowledge of the language was elementary  

why you take our puff-bangs away  we very angry with you  we not
afraid 

on westons hypothesis his action ought to have been impressive 
unfortunately for him  no one else shared his theory of the elderly
 hrosss  behaviour  the  hross —who was well known to all of them 
including ransom—had not come with the funeral procession  it had been in
its place since dawn  doubtless it intended no disrespect to oyarsa  but
it must be confessed that it had yielded  at a much earlier stage in the
proceedings  to an infirmity which attacks elderly  hnau  of all species 
and was by this time enjoying a profound and refreshing slumber  one of
its whiskers twitched a little as weston shouted in its face  but its
eyes remained shut 

the voice of oyarsa spoke again  why do you speak to him  it said  it
is i who ask you  why have you killed my  hnau  

you let us go  then we talkee-talkee  bellowed weston at the sleeping
 hross   you think we no power  think you do all you like  you no can 
great big head-man in sky he send us  you no do what i say  he come  blow
you all up—pouff  bang 

i do not know what  bang  means  said the voice  but why have you
killed my  hnau  

say it was an accident  muttered devine to weston in english 

ive told you before  replied weston in the same language  you dont
understand how to deal with natives  one sign of yielding and theyll be
at our throats  the only thing is to intimidate them 

all right  do your stuff  then  growled devine  he was obviously losing
faith in his partner 

weston cleared his throat and again rounded on the elderly  hross  

we kill him  he shouted  show what we can do  every one who no do all
we say—pouff  bang —kill him same as that one  you do all we say and we
give you much pretty things  see  see  to ransoms intense discomfort 
weston at this point whipped out of his pocket a brightly coloured
necklace of beads  the undoubted work of mr  woolworth  and began
dangling it in front of the faces of his guards  turning slowly round and
round and repeating  pretty  pretty  see  see 

the result of this manœuvre was more striking than weston himself had
anticipated  such a roar of sounds as human ears had never heard
before—baying of  hrossa   piping of  pfifltriggi   booming of
 sorns —burst out and rent the silence of that august place  waking
echoes from the distant mountain walls  even in the air above them there
was a faint ringing of the  eldil  voices  it is greatly to westons
credit that though he paled at this he did not lose his nerve 

you no roar at me  he thundered  no try make me afraid  me no afraid
of you 

you must forgive my people  said the voice of oyarsa—and even it was
subtly changed—but they are not roaring at you  they are only laughing 

but weston did not know the malacandrian word for  laugh   indeed  it was
not a word he understood very well in any language  he looked about him
with a puzzled expression  ransom  biting his lips with mortification 
almost prayed that one experiment with the beads would satisfy the
scientist  but that was because he did not know weston  the latter saw
that the clamour had subsided  he knew that he was following the most
orthodox rules for frightening and then conciliating primitive races  and
he was not the man to be deterred by one or two failures  the roar that
went up from the throats of all spectators as he again began revolving
like a slow-motion picture of a humming-top  occasionally mopping his
brow with his left hand and conscientiously jerking the necklace up and
down with his right  completely drowned anything he might be attempting
to say  but ransom saw his lips moving and had little doubt that he was
working away at pretty  pretty  then suddenly the sound of laughter
almost redoubled its volume  the stars in their courses were fighting
against weston  some hazy memory of efforts made long since to entertain
an infant niece had begun to penetrate his highly trained mind  he was
bobbing up and down from the knees and holding his head on one side  he
was almost dancing  and he was by now very hot indeed  for all ransom
knew he was saying diddle  diddle  diddle 

it was sheer exhaustion which ended the great physicists performance—the
most successful of its kind ever given on malacandra—and with it the
sonorous raptures of his audience  as silence returned ransom heard
devines voice in english 

for gods sake stop making a buffoon of yourself  weston  it said 
cant you see it wont work 

it  doesnt  seem to be working  admitted weston  and im inclined to
think they have even less intelligence than we supposed  do you think 
perhaps  if i tried it just once again—or would you like to try this
time 

oh  hell  said devine  and  turning his back on his partner  sat down
abruptly on the ground  produced his cigarette-case and began to smoke 

ill give it to the witch-doctor  said weston during the moment of
silence which devines action had produced among the mystified
spectators  and before anyone could stop him he took a step forward and
attempted to drop the string of beads round the elderly  hrosss  neck 
the  hrosss  head was  however  too large for this operation and the
necklace merely settled on its forehead like a crown  slightly over one
eye  it shifted its head a little  like a dog worried with flies  snorted
gently  and resumed its sleep 

oyarsas voice now addressed ransom  are your fellow-creatures hurt in
their brains  ransom of thulcandra  it said  or are they too much
afraid to answer my questions 

i think  oyarsa  said ransom  that they do not believe you are there 
and they believe that all these  hnau  are—are like very young cubs  the
thicker  hmān  is trying to frighten them and then to please them with
gifts 

at the sound of ransoms voice the two prisoners turned sharply around 
weston was about to speak when ransom interrupted him hastily in english 

listen  weston  it is not a trick  there really is a creature there in
the middle—there where you can see a kind of light  or a kind of
something  if you look hard  and it is at least as intelligent as a
man—they seem to live an enormous time  stop treating it like a child and
answer its questions  and if you take my advice  youll speak the truth
and not bluster 

the brutes seem to have intelligence enough to take you in  anyway 
growled weston  but it was in a somewhat modified voice that he turned
once more to the sleeping  hross —the desire to wake up the supposed
witch-doctor was becoming an obsession—and addressed it 

we sorry we kill him  he said  pointing to hyoi  no go to kill him 
 sorns  tell us bring man  give him your big head  we go away back into
sky   he  come  here he indicated ransom  with us  he very bent man  run
away  no do what  sorns  say like us  we run after him  get him back for
 sorns   want to do what we say and  sorns  tell us  see  he not let us 
run away  run  run  we run after  see big black one  think he kill us  we
kill him—pouff  bang  all for bent man  he no run away  he be good  we no
run after  no kill big black one  see  you have bent man—bent man make
all trouble—you plenty keep him  let us go  he afraid of you  we no
afraid  listen——

at this moment westons continual bellowing in the face of the  hross  at
last produced the effect he had striven for so long  the creature opened
its eyes and stared mildly at him in some perplexity  then  gradually
realizing the impropriety of which it had been guilty  it rose slowly to
its standing position  bowed respectfully to oyarsa  and finally waddled
out of the assembly still carrying the necklace draped over its right ear
and eye  weston  his mouth still open  followed the retreating figure
with his gaze till it vanished among the stems of the grove 

it was oyarsa who broke the silence  we have had mirth enough  he said 
and it is time to hear true answers to our questions  something is wrong
in your head   hnau  from thulcandra  there is too much blood in it  is
firikitekila here 

here  oyarsa  said a  pfifltrigg  

have you in your cisterns water that has been made cold 

yes  oyarsa 

then let this thick  hnau  be taken to the guesthouse and let them bathe
his head in cold water  much water and many times  then bring him again 
meanwhile i will provide for my killed  hrossa  

weston did not clearly understand what the voice said—indeed  he was
still too busy trying to find out where it came from—but terror smote him
as he found himself wrapped in the strong arms of the surrounding
 hrossa  and forced away from his place  ransom would gladly have shouted
out some reassurance  but weston himself was shouting too loud to hear
him  he was mixing english and malacandrian now  and the last that was
heard was a rising scream of pay for this—pouff  bang —ransom  for gods
sake—ransom  ransom 

and now  said oyarsa  when silence was restored  let us honour my dead
 hnau  

at his words ten of the  hrossa  grouped themselves about the biers 
lifting their heads  and with no signal given as far as ransom could see 
they began to sing 

to every man  in his acquaintance with a new art  there comes a moment
when that which before was meaningless first lifts  as it were  one
corner of the curtain that hides its mystery  and reveals  in a burst of
delight which later and fuller understanding can hardly ever equal  one
glimpse of the indefinite possibilities within  for ransom  this moment
had now come in his understanding of malacandrian song  now first he saw
that its rhythms were based on a different blood from ours  on a heart
that beat more quickly  and a fiercer internal heat  through his
knowledge of the creatures and his love for them he began  ever so
little  to hear it with their ears  a sense of great masses moving at
visionary speeds  of giants dancing  of eternal sorrows eternally
consoled  of he knew not what and yet what he had always known  awoke in
him with the very first bars of the deep-mouthed dirge  and bowed down
his spirit as if the gate of heaven had opened before him 

let it go hence  they sang  let it go hence  dissolve and be no body 
drop it  release it  drop it gently  as a stone is loosed from fingers
drooping over a still pool  let it go down  sink  fall away  once below
the surface there are no divisions  no layers in the water yielding all
the way down  all one and all unwounded is that element  send it voyaging
it will not come again  let it go down  the  hnau  rises from it  this is
the second life  the other beginning  open  oh coloured world  without
weight  without shore  you are second and better  this was first and
feeble  once the worlds were hot within and brought forth life  but only
the pale plants  the dark plants  we see their children when they grow
to-day  out of the suns light in the sad places  after  the heaven made
grow another kind on worlds  the high climbers  the bright-haired
forests  cheeks of flowers  first were the darker  then the brighter 
first was the worlds brood  then the suns brood 

this was as much of it as he contrived later to remember and could
translate  as the song ended oyarsa said 

let us scatter the movements which were their bodies  so will maleldil
scatter all worlds when the first and feeble is worn 

he made a sign to one of the  pfifltriggi   who instantly arose and
approached the corpses  the  hrossa   now singing again but very softly 
drew back at least ten paces  the  pfifltrigg  touched each of the three
dead in turn with some small object that appeared to be made of glass or
crystal—and then jumped away with one of his frog-like leaps  ransom
closed his eyes to protect them from a blinding light and felt something
like a very strong wind blowing in his face  for a fraction of a second 
then all was calm again  and the three biers were empty 

god  that would be a trick worth knowing on earth  said devine to
ransom  solves the murderers problem about the disposal of the body 
eh 

but ransom  who was thinking of hyoi  did not answer him  and before he
spoke again everyones attention was diverted by the return of the
unhappy weston among his guards 




                                 twenty


the  hross  who headed this procession was a conscientious creature and
began at once explaining itself in a rather troubled voice 

i hope we have done right  oyarsa  it said  but we do not know  we
dipped his head in the cold water seven times  but the seventh time
something fell off it  we had thought it was the top of his head  but now
we saw it was a covering made of the skin of some other creature  then
some said we had done your will with the seven dips  and others said not 
in the end we dipped it seven times more  we hope that was right  the
creature talked a lot between the dips  and most between the second
seven  but we could not understand it 

you have done very well  hnoo  said oyarsa  stand away that i may see
it  for now i will speak to it 

the guards fell away on each side  westons usually pale face  under the
bracing influence of the cold water  had assumed the colour of a ripe
tomato  and his hair  which had naturally not been cut since he reached
malacandra  was plastered in straight  lank masses across his forehead  a
good deal of water was still dripping over his nose and ears  his
expression—unfortunately wasted on an audience ignorant of terrestrial
physiognomy—was that of a brave man suffering in a great cause  and
rather eager than reluctant to face the worst or even to provoke it  in
explanation of his conduct it is only fair to remember that he had
already that morning endured all the terrors of an expected martyrdom and
all the anticlimax of fourteen compulsory cold douches  devine  who knew
his man  shouted out to weston in english 

steady  weston  these devils can split the atom or something pretty like
it  be careful what you say to them and dont lets have any of your
bloody nonsense 

huh  said weston  so youve gone native too 

be silent  said the voice of oyarsa  you  thick one  have told me
nothing of yourself  so i will tell it to you  in your own world you have
attained great wisdom concerning bodies and by this you have been able to
make a ship that can cross the heaven  but in all other things you have
the mind of an animal  when first you came here  i sent for you  meaning
you nothing but honour  the darkness in your own mind filled you with
fear  because you thought i meant evil to you  you went as a beast goes
against a beast of some other kind  and snared this ransom  you would
give him up to the evil you feared  to-day  seeing him here  to save your
own life  you would have given him to me a second time  still thinking i
meant him hurt  these are your dealings with your own kind  and what you
intend to my people  i know  already you have killed some  and you have
come here to kill them all  to you it is nothing whether a creature is
 hnau  or not  at first i thought this was because you cared only whether
a creature had a body like your own  but ransom has that and you would
kill him as lightly as any of my  hnau   i did not know that the bent one
had done so much in your world and still i do not understand it  if you
were mine  i would unbody you even now  do not think follies  by my hand
maleldil does greater things than this  and i can unmake you even on the
borders of your own worlds air  but i do not yet resolve to do this  it
is for you to speak  let me see if there is anything in your mind besides
fear and death and desire 

weston turned to ransom  i see  he said  that you have chosen the most
momentous crisis in the history of the human race to betray it  then he
turned in the direction of the voice 

i know you kill us  he said  me not afraid  others come  make it our
world——

but devine had jumped to his feet  and interrupted him 

no  no  oyarsa  he shouted  you no listen him  he very foolish man  he
have dreams  we little people  only want pretty sun-bloods  you give us
plenty sun-bloods  we go back into sky  you never see us no more  all
done  see 

silence  said oyarsa  there was an almost imperceptible change in the
light  if it could be called light  out of which the voice came  and
devine crumpled up and fell back on the ground  when he resumed his
sitting position he was white and panting 

speak on  said oyarsa to weston 

me no       no  began weston in malacandrian and then broke off  i
cant say what i want in their accursed language  he said in english 

speak to ransom and he shall turn it into our speech  said oyarsa 

weston accepted the arrangement at once  he believed that the hour of his
death was come and he was determined to utter the thing—almost the only
thing outside his own science—which he had to say  he cleared his throat 
almost he struck a gesture  and began 

to you i may seem a vulgar robber  but i bear on my shoulders the
destiny of the human race  your tribal life with its stone-age weapons
and beehive huts  its primitive coracles and elementary social structure 
has nothing to compare with our civilization—with our science  medicine
and law  our armies  our architecture  our commerce  and our transport
system which is rapidly annihilating space and time  our right to
supersede you is the right of the higher over the lower  life——

half a moment  said ransom in english  thats about as much as i can
manage at one go  then  turning to oyarsa  he began translating as well
as he could  the process was difficult and the result—which he felt to be
rather unsatisfactory—was something like this 

among us  oyarsa  there is a kind of  hnau  who will take other  hnaus 
food and—and things  when they are not looking  he says he is not an
ordinary one of that kind  he says what he does now will make very
different things happen to those of our people who are not yet born  he
says that  among you   hnau  of one kindred all live together and the
 hrossa  have spears like those we used a very long time ago and your
huts are small and round and your boats small and light and like our old
ones  and you have only one ruler  he says it is different with us  he
says we know much  there is a thing happens in our world when the body of
a living creature feels pains and becomes weak  and he says we sometimes
know how to stop it  he says we have many bent people and we kill them or
shut them in huts and that we have people for settling quarrels between
the bent  hnau  about their huts and mates and things  he says we have
many ways for the  hnau  of one land to kill those of another and some
are trained to do it  he says we build very big and strong huts of stones
and other things—like the  pfifltriggi   and he says we exchange many
things among ourselves and can carry heavy weights very quickly a long
way  because of all this  he says it would not be the act of a bent
 hnau  if our people killed all your people 

as soon as ransom had finished  weston continued 

life is greater than any system of morality  her claims are absolute  it
is not by tribal taboos and copy-book maxims that she has pursued her
relentless march from the amœba to man and from man to civilization 

he says  began ransom  that living creatures are stronger than the
question whether an act is bent or good—no  that cannot be right—he says
it is better to be alive and bent than to be dead—no—he says  he says—i
cannot say what he says  oyarsa  in your language  but he goes on to say
that the only good thing is that there should be very many creatures
alive  he says there were many other animals before the first men and the
later ones were better than the earlier ones  but he says the animals
were not born because of what is said to the young about bent and good
action by their elders  and he says these animals did not feel any pity 

she—— began weston 

im sorry  interrupted ransom  but ive forgotten who she is 

life  of course  snapped weston  she has ruthlessly broken down all
obstacles and liquidated all failures and to-day in her highest
form—civilized man—and in me as his representative  she presses forward
to that interplanetary leap which will  perhaps  place her for ever
beyond the reach of death 

he says  resumed ransom  that these animals learned to do many
difficult things  except those who could not  and those ones died and the
other animals did not pity them  and he says the best animal now is the
kind of man who makes the big huts and carries the heavy weights and does
all the other things i told you about  and he is one of these and he says
that if the others all knew what he was doing they would be pleased  he
says that if he could kill you all and bring our people to live in
malacandra  then they might be able to go on living here after something
had gone wrong with our world  and then if something went wrong with
malacandra they might go and kill all the  hnau  in another world  and
then another—and so they would never die out 

it is in her right  said weston  the right  or  if you will  the might
of life herself  that i am prepared without flinching to plant the flag
of man on the soil of malacandra  to march on  step by step  superseding 
where necessary  the lower forms of life that we find  claiming planet
after planet  system after system  till our posterity—whatever strange
form and yet unguessed mentality they have assumed—dwell in the universe
wherever the universe is habitable 

he says  translated ransom  that because of this it would  not  be a
bent action—or else  he says  it  would  be a possible action—for him to
kill you all and bring us here  he says he would feel no pity  he is
saying again that perhaps they would be able to keep moving from one
world to another and wherever they came they would kill everyone  i think
he is now talking about worlds that go round other suns  he wants the
creatures born from us to be in as many places as they can  he says he
does not know what kind of creatures they will be 

i may fall  said weston  but while i live i will not  with such a key
in my hand  consent to close the gates of the future on my race  what
lies in that future  beyond our present ken  passes imagination to
conceive  it is enough for me that there is a beyond 

he is saying  ransom translated  that he will not stop trying to do
all this unless you kill him  and he says that though he doesnt know
what will happen to the creatures sprung from us  he wants it to happen
very much 

weston  who had now finished his statement  looked round instinctively
for a chair to sink into  on earth he usually sank into a chair as the
applause began  finding none—he was not the kind of man to sit on the
ground like devine—he folded his arms and stared with a certain dignity
about him 

it is well that i have heard you  said oyarsa  for though your mind is
feebler  your will is less bent than i thought  it is not for yourself
that you would do all this 

no  said weston proudly in malacandrian  me die  man live 

yet you know that these creatures would have to be made quite unlike you
before they lived on other worlds 

yes  yes  all new  no one know yet  strange  big 

then it is not the shape of body that you love 

no  me no care how they shaped 

one would think  then  that it is for the mind you care  but that cannot
be  or you would love  hnau  wherever you met it 

no care for  hnau   care for man 

but if it is neither mans mind  which is as the mind of all other
 hnau —is not maleldil maker of them all —nor his body  which will
change—if you care for neither of these  what do you mean by man 

this had to be translated to weston  when he understood it  he replied 

me care for man—care for our race—what man begets—— he had to ask
ransom the words for  race  and  beget  

strange  said oyarsa  you do not love any one of your race—you would
have let me kill ransom  you do not love the mind of your race  nor the
body  any kind of creature will please you if only it is begotten by your
kind as they now are  it seems to me  thick one  that what you really
love is no completed creature but the very seed itself  for that is all
that is left 

tell him  said weston when he had been made to understand this  that i
dont pretend to be a metaphysician  i have not come here to chop logic 
if he cannot understand—as apparently you cant either—anything so
fundamental as a mans loyalty to humanity  i cant make him understand
it 

but ransom was unable to translate this and the voice of oyarsa
continued 

i see now how the lord of the silent world has bent you  there are laws
that all  hnau  know  of pity and straight dealing and shame and the
like  and one of these is the love of kindred  he has taught you to break
all of them except this one  which is not one of the greatest laws  this
one he has bent till it becomes folly and has set it up  thus bent  to be
a little  blind oyarsa in your brain  and now you can do nothing but obey
it  though if we ask you why it is a law you can give no other reason for
it than for all the other and greater laws which it drives you to
disobey  do you know why he has done this 

me think no such person—me wise  new man—no believe all that old talk 

i will tell you  he has left you this one because a bent  hnau  can do
more evil than a broken one  he has only bent you  but this thin one who
sits on the ground he has broken  for he has left him nothing but greed 
he is now only a talking animal and in my world he could do no more evil
than an animal  if he were mine i would unmake his body  for the  hnau 
in it is already dead  but if you were mine i would try to cure you  tell
me  thick one  why did you come here 

me tell you  make man live all the time 

but are your wise men so ignorant as not to know that malacandra is
older than your own world and nearer its death  most of it is dead
already  my people live only in the  handramits   the heat and the water
have been more and will be less  soon now  very soon  i will end my world
and give back my people to maleldil 

me know all that plenty  this only first try  soon they go on another
world 

but do you not know that all worlds will die 

men go jump off each before it deads—on and on  see 

and when all are dead 

weston was silent  after a time oyarsa spoke again 

do you not ask why my people  whose world is old  have not rather come
to yours and taken it long ago 

ho  ho  said weston  you not know how 

you are wrong  said oyarsa  many thousands of thousand years before
this  when nothing yet lived on your world  the cold death was coming on
my  harandra   then i was in deep trouble  not chiefly for the death of
my  hnau —maleldil does not make them long-livers—but for the things
which the lord of your world  who was not yet bound  put into their
minds  he would have made them as your people are now—wise enough to see
the death of their kind approaching but not wise enough to endure it 
bent counsels would soon have risen among them  they were well able to
have made sky-ships  by me maleldil stopped them  some i cured  some i
unbodied——

and see what come  interrupted weston  you now very few—shut up in
 handramits —soon all die 

yes  said oyarsa  but one thing we left behind us on the  harandra  
fear  and with fear  murder and rebellion  the weakest of my people does
not fear death  it is the bent one  the lord of your world  who wastes
your lives and befouls them with flying from what you know will overtake
you in the end  if you were subjects of maleldil you would have peace 

weston writhed in the exasperation born of his desire to speak and his
ignorance of the language 

trash  defeatist trash  he shouted at oyarsa in english  then  drawing
himself up to his full height  he added in malacandrian  you say your
maleldil let all go dead  other one  bent one  he fight  jump  live—not
all talkee-talkee  me no care maleldil  like bent one better  me on his
side 

but do you not see that he never will nor can  began oyarsa  and then
broke off  as if recollecting himself  but i must learn more of your
world from ransom  and for that i need till night  i will not kill you 
not even the thin one  for you are out of my world  to-morrow you shall
go hence again in your ship 

devines face suddenly fell  he began talking rapidly in english 

for gods sake  weston  make him understand  weve been here for
months—the earth is not in opposition now  tell him it cant be done  he
might as well kill us at once 

how long will your journey be to thulcandra  asked oyarsa 

weston  using ransom as his interpreter  explained that the journey  in
the present position of the two planets  was almost impossible  the
distance had increased by millions of miles  the angle of their course to
the solar rays would be totally different from that which he had counted
upon  even if by a hundredth chance they could hit the earth  it was
almost certain that their supply of oxygen would be exhausted long before
they arrived 

tell him to kill us now  he added 

all this i know  said oyarsa  and if you stay in my world i must kill
you  no such creature will i suffer in malacandra  i know there is small
chance of your reaching your world  but small is not the same as none 
between now and the next noon choose which you will take  in the
meantime  tell me this  if you reach it at all  what is the most time you
will need 

after a prolonged calculation  weston  in a shaken voice  replied that if
they had not made it in ninety days they would never make it  and they
would  moreover  be dead of suffocation 

ninety days you shall have  said oyarsa  my  sorns  and  pfifltriggi 
will give you air  we also have that art  and food for ninety days  but
they will do something else to your ship  i am not minded that it should
return into the heaven if once it reaches thulcandra  you  thick one 
were not here when i unmade my dead  hrossa  whom you killed  the thin
one will tell you  this i can do  as maleldil has taught me  over a gap
of time or a gap of place  before your sky-ship rises  my  sorns  will
have so dealt with it that on the ninetieth day it will unbody  it will
become what you call nothing  if that day finds it in heaven your death
will be no bitterer because of this  but do not tarry in your ship if
once you touch thulcandra  now lead these two away  and do you  my
children  go where you will  but i must talk with ransom 




                               twenty-one


all that afternoon ransom remained alone answering oyarsas questions  i
am not allowed to record this conversation  beyond saying that the voice
concluded it with the words 

you have shown me more wonders than are known in the whole of heaven 

after that they discussed ransoms own future  he was given full liberty
to remain in malacandra or to attempt the desperate voyage to earth  the
problem was agonizing to him  in the end he decided to throw in his lot
with weston and devine 

love of our own kind  he said  is not the greatest of laws  but you 
oyarsa  have said it is a law  if i cannot live in thulcandra  it is
better for me not to live at all 

you have chosen rightly  said oyarsa  and i will tell you two things 
my people will take all the strange weapons out of the ship  but they
will give one to you  and the  eldila  of deep heaven will be about your
ship till it reaches the air of thulcandra  and often in it  they will
not let the other two kill you 

it had not occurred to ransom before that his own murder might be one of
the first expedients for economizing food and oxygen which would occur to
weston and devine  he was now astonished at his obtuseness  and thanked
oyarsa for his protective measures  then the great  eldil  dismissed him
with these words 

you are guilty of no evil  ransom of thulcandra  except a little
fearfulness  for that  the journey you go on is your pain  and perhaps
your cure  for you must be either mad or brave before it is ended  but i
lay also a command on you  you must watch this weston and this devine in
thulcandra if ever you arrive there  they may yet do much evil in  and
beyond  your world  from what you have told me  i begin to see that there
are  eldila  who go down into your air  into the very stronghold of the
bent one  your world is not so fast shut as was thought in these parts of
heaven  watch those two bent ones  be courageous  fight them  and when
you have need  some of our people will help  maleldil will show them to
you  it may even be that you and i shall meet again while you are still
in the body  for it is not without the wisdom of maleldil that we have
met now and i have learned so much of your world  it seems to me that
this is the beginning of more comings and goings between the heavens and
the worlds and between one world and another—though not such as the thick
one hoped  i am allowed to tell you this  the year we are now in—but
heavenly years are not as yours—has long been prophesied as a year of
stirrings and high changes and the siege of thulcandra may be near its
end  great things are on foot  if maleldil does not forbid me  i will not
hold aloof from them  and now  farewell 

it was through vast crowds of all the malacandrian species that the three
human beings embarked next day on their terrible journey  weston was pale
and haggard from a night of calculations intricate enough to tax any
mathematician even if his life did not hang on them  devine was noisy 
reckless and a little hysterical  his whole view of malacandra had been
altered overnight by the discovery that the natives had an alcoholic
drink  and he had even been trying to teach them to smoke  only the
 pfifltriggi  had made much of it  he was now consoling himself for an
acute headache and the prospect of a lingering death by tormenting
weston  neither partner was pleased to find that all weapons had been
removed from the space-ship  but in other respects everything was as they
wished it  at about an hour after noon ransom took a last  long look at
the blue waters  purple forest and remote green walls of the familiar
 handramit   and followed the other two through the manhole  before it
was closed weston warned them that they must economize air by absolute
stillness  no unnecessary movement must be made during their voyage  even
talking must be prohibited 

i shall speak only in an emergency  he said 

thank god for that  anyway  was devines last shot  then they screwed
themselves in 

ransom went at once to the lower side of the sphere  into the chamber
which was now most completely upside down  and stretched himself on what
would later become its skylight  he was surprised to find that they were
already thousands of feet up  the  handramit  was only a straight purple
line across the rose-red surface of the  harandra   they were above the
junction of two  handramits   one of them was doubtless that in which he
had lived  the other that which contained meldilorn  the gully by which
he had cut off the corner between the two  on augrays shoulders  was
quite invisible 

each minute more  handramits  came into view—long straight lines  some
parallel  some intersecting  some building triangles  the landscape
became increasingly geometrical  the waste between the purple lines
appeared perfectly flat  the rosy colour of the petrified forests
accounted for its tint immediately below him  but to the north and east
the great sand deserts of which the  sorns  had told him were now
appearing as illimitable stretches of yellow and ochre  to the west a
huge discoloration began to show  it was an irregular patch of greenish
blue that looked as if it were sunk below the level of the surrounding
 harandra   he concluded it was the forest low-land of the
 pfifltriggi —or rather one of their forest lowlands  for now similar
patches were appearing in all directions  some of them mere blobs at the
intersection of  handramits   some of vast extent  he became vividly
conscious that his knowledge of malacandra was minute  local  parochial 
it was as if a  sorn  had journeyed forty million miles to the earth and
spent his stay there between worthing and brighton  he reflected that he
would have very little to show for his amazing voyage if he survived it 
a smattering of the language  a few landscapes  some half-understood
physics—but where were the statistics  the history  the broad survey of
extraterrestrial conditions  which such a traveller ought to bring back 
those  handramits   for example  seen from the height which the
space-ship had now attained  in all their unmistakable geometry  they put
to shame his original impression that they were natural valleys  they
were gigantic feats of engineering  about which he had learned nothing 
feats accomplished  if all were true  before human history began      
before animal history began  or was that only mythology  he knew it would
seem like mythology when he got back to earth  if he ever got back   but
the presence of oyarsa was still too fresh a memory to allow him any real
doubts  it even occurred to him that the distinction between history and
mythology might be itself meaningless outside the earth 

the thought baffled him  and he turned again to the landscape below—the
landscape which became every moment less of a landscape and more of a
diagram  by this time  to the east  a much larger and darker patch of
discoloration than he had yet seen was pushing its way into the reddish
ochre of the malacandrian world—a curiously shaped patch with long arms
or horns extended on each side and a sort of bay between them  like the
concave side of a crescent  it grew and grew  the wide dark arms seemed
to be spread out to engulf the whole planet  suddenly he saw a bright
point of light in the middle of this dark patch and realized that it was
not a patch on the surface of the planet at all  but the black sky
showing behind her  the smooth curve was the edge of her disk  at this 
for the first time since their embarkation  fear took hold of him 
slowly  yet not too slowly for him to see  the dark arms spread farther
and ever farther round the lighted surface till at last they met  the
whole disk  framed in blackness  was before him  the faint percussions of
the meteorites had long been audible  the window through which he was
gazing was no longer definitely beneath him  his limbs  though already
very light  were almost too stiff to move  and he was very hungry  he
looked at his watch  he had been at his post  spell-bound  for nearly
eight hours 

he made his way with difficulty to the sunward side of the ship and
reeled back almost blinded with the glory of the light  groping  he found
his darkened glasses in his old cabin and got himself food and water 
weston had rationed them strictly in both  he opened the door of the
control-room and looked in  both the partners  their faces drawn with
anxiety  were seated before a kind of metal table  it was covered with
delicate  gently vibrating instruments in which crystal and fine wire
were the predominant materials  both ignored his presence  for the rest
of the silent journey he was free of the whole ship 

when he returned to the dark side  the world they were leaving hung in
the star-strewn sky not much bigger than our earthly moon  its colours
were still visible—a reddish-yellow disk blotched with greenish-blue and
capped with white at the poles  he saw the two tiny malacandrian
moons—their movement quite perceptible—and reflected that they were among
the thousand things he had not noticed during his sojourn there  he
slept  and woke  and saw the disk still hanging in the sky  it was
smaller than the moon now  its colours were gone except for a faint 
uniform tinge of redness in its light  even the light was not now
incomparably stronger than that of the countless stars which surrounded
it  it had ceased to be malacandra  it was only mars 

he soon fell back into his old routine of sleeping and basking 
punctuated with the making of some scribbled notes for his malacandrian
dictionary  he knew that there was very little chance of his being able
to communicate his new knowledge to man  that unrecorded death in the
depth of space would almost certainly be the end of their adventure  but
already it had become impossible to think of it as space  some moments
of cold fear he had  but each time they were shorter and more quickly
swallowed up in a sense of awe which made his personal fate seem wholly
insignificant  he could not feel that they were an island of life
journeying through an abyss of death  he felt almost the opposite—that
life was waiting outside the little iron egg-shell in which they rode 
ready at any moment to break in  and that  if it killed them  it would
kill them by excess of its vitality  he hoped passionately that if they
were to perish they would perish by the unbodying of the space-ship and
not by suffocation within it  to be let out  to be set free  to dissolve
into the ocean of eternal noon  seemed to him at certain moments a
consummation even more desirable than their return to earth  and if he
had felt some such lift of the heart when first he passed through heaven
on their outward journey  he felt it now tenfold  for now he was
convinced that the abyss was full of life in the most literal sense  full
of living creatures 

his confidence in oyarsas words about the  eldila  increased rather than
diminished as they went on  he saw none of them  the intensity of light
in which the ship swam allowed none of the fugitive variations which
would have betrayed their presence  but he heard  or thought he heard 
all kinds of delicate sound  or vibrations akin to sound  mixed with the
tinkling rain of meteorites  and often the sense of unseen presences even
within the space-ship became irresistible  it was this  more than
anything else  that made his own chances of life seem so unimportant  he
and all his race showed small and ephemeral against a background of such
immeasurable fullness  his brain reeled at the thought of the true
population of the universe  the three-dimensional infinitude of their
territory  and the unchronicled æons of their past  but his heart became
steadier than it had ever been 

it was well for him that he had reached this frame of mind before the
real hardships of their journey began  ever since their departure from
malacandra  the thermometer had steadily risen  now it was higher than it
had stood at any time on their outward journey  and still it rose  the
light also increased  under his glasses he kept his eyes habitually tight
shut  opening them only for the shortest time for necessary movements  he
knew that if he reached earth it would be with permanently damaged sight 
but all this was nothing to the torment of heat  all three of them were
awake for twenty-four hours out of the twenty-four  enduring with dilated
eyeballs  blackened lips and froth-flecked cheeks the agony of thirst  it
would be madness to increase their scanty rations of water  madness even
to consume air in discussing the question 

he saw well enough what was happening  in his last bid for life weston
was venturing inside the earths orbit  leading them nearer the sun than
man  perhaps than life  had ever been  presumably this was unavoidable 
one could not follow a retreating earth round the rim of its own wheeling
course  they must be trying to meet it—to cut across       it was
madness  but the question did not much occupy his mind  it was not
possible for long to think of anything but thirst  one thought of water 
then one thought of thirst  then one thought of thinking of thirst  then
of water again  and still the thermometer rose  the walls of the ship
were too hot to touch  it was obvious that a crisis was approaching  in
the next few hours it must kill them or get less 

it got less  there came a time when they lay exhausted and shivering in
what seemed the cold  though it was still hotter than any terrestrial
climate  weston had so far succeeded  he had risked the highest
temperature at which human life could theoretically survive  and they had
lived through it  but they were not the same men  hitherto weston had
slept very little even in his watches off  always  after an hour or so of
uneasy rest  he had returned to his charts and to his endless  almost
despairing  calculations  you could see him fighting the despair—pinning
his terrified brain down  and again down  to the figures  now he never
looked at them  he even seemed careless in the control-room  devine moved
and looked like a somnambulist  ransom lived increasingly on the dark
side and for long hours he thought of nothing  although the first great
danger was past  none of them  at this time  had any serious hope of a
successful issue to their journey  they had now been fifty days  without
speech  in their steel shell  and the air was already very bad 

weston was so unlike his old self that he even allowed ransom to take his
share in the navigation  mainly by signs  but with the help of a few
whispered words  he taught him all that was necessary at this stage of
the journey  apparently they were racing home—but with little chance of
reaching it in time—before some sort of cosmic trade-wind  a few rules
of thumb enabled ransom to keep the star which weston pointed out to him
in its position at the centre of the skylight  but always with his left
hand on the bell to westons cabin 

this star was not the earth  the days—the purely theoretical days which
bore such a desperately practical meaning for the travellers—mounted to
fifty-eight before weston changed course  and a different luminary was in
the centre  sixty days  and it was visibly a planet  sixty-six  and it
was like a planet seen through field-glasses  seventy and it was like
nothing that ransom had ever seen—a little dazzling disk too large for a
planet and far too small for the moon  now that he was navigating  his
celestial mood was shattered  wild  animal thirst for life  mixed with
homesick longing for the free airs and the sights and smells of earth—for
grass and meat and beer and tea and the human voice—awoke in him  at
first his chief difficulty on watch had been to resist drowsiness  now 
though the air was worse  feverish excitement kept him vigilant  often
when he came off duty he found his right arm stiff and sore  for hours he
had been pressing it unconsciously against the control-board as if his
puny thrust could spur the space-ship to yet greater speed 

now they had twenty days to go  nineteen—eighteen—and on the white
terrestrial disk  now a little larger than a sixpence  he thought he
could make out australia and the south-east corner of asia  hour after
hour  though the markings moved slowly across the disk with the earths
diurnal revolution  the disk itself refused to grow larger  get on  get
on  ransom muttered to the ship  now ten days were left and it was like
the moon and so bright that they could not look steadily at it  the air
in their little sphere was ominously bad  but ransom and devine risked a
whisper as they changed watches 

well do it  they said  well do it yet 

on the eighty-seventh day  when ransom relieved devine  he thought there
was something wrong with the earth  before his watch was done  he was
sure  it was no longer a true circle  but bulging a little on one side 
it was almost pear-shaped  when weston came on duty he gave one glance at
the sky-light  rang furiously on the bell for devine  thrust ransom
aside  and took the navigating seat  his face was the colour of putty  he
seemed to be about to so something to the controls  but as devine entered
the room he looked up and shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of
despair  then he buried his face in his hands and laid his head down on
the control-board 

ransom and devine exchanged glances  they bundled weston out of the
seat—he was crying like a child—and devine took his place  and now at
last ransom understood the mystery of the bulging earth  what had
appeared as a bulge on one side of her disk was becoming increasingly
distinct as a second disk  a disk almost as large in appearance as her
own  it was covering more than half of the earth  it was the moon—between
them and the earth  and two hundred and forty thousand miles nearer 
ransom did not know what fate this might mean for the space-ship  devine
obviously did  and never had he appeared so admirable  his face was as
pale as westons  but his eyes were clear and preternaturally bright  he
sat crouched over the controls like an animal about to spring and he was
whistling very softly between his teeth 

hours later ransom understood what was happening  the moons disk was now
larger than the earths  and very gradually it became apparent to him
that both disks were diminishing in size  the space-ship was no longer
approaching either the earth or the moon  it was farther away from them
than it had been half an hour ago  and that was the meaning of devines
feverish activity with the controls  it was not merely that the moon was
crossing their path and cutting them off from the earth  apparently for
some reason—probably gravitational—it was dangerous to get too close to
the moon  and devine was standing off into space  in sight of harbour
they were being forced to turn back to the open sea  he glanced up at the
chronometer  it was the morning of the eighty-eighth day  two days to
make the earth  and they were moving away from her 

i suppose this finishes us  he whispered 

expect so  whispered devine  without looking round 

weston presently recovered sufficiently to come back and stand beside
devine  there was nothing for ransom to do  he was sure  now  that they
were soon to die  with this realization  the agony of his suspense
suddenly disappeared  death  whether it came now or some thirty years
later on earth  rose up and claimed his attention  there are preparations
a man likes to make  he left the control-room and returned into one of
the sunward chambers  into the indifference of the moveless light  the
warmth  the silence and the sharp-cut shadows  nothing was farther from
his mind than sleep  it must have been the exhausted atmosphere which
made him drowsy  he slept 

he awoke in almost complete darkness in the midst of a loud continuous
noise  which he could not at first identify  it reminded him of
something—something he seemed to have heard in a previous existence  it
was a prolonged drumming noise close above his head  suddenly his heart
gave a great leap 

oh god  he sobbed  oh god  its  rain  

he was on earth  the air was heavy and stale about him  but the choking
sensations he had been suffering were gone  he realized that he was still
in the space-ship  the others  in fear of its threatened unbodying  had
characteristically abandoned it the moment it touched earth and left him
to his fate  it was difficult in the dark  and under the crushing weight
of terrestrial gravity  to find his way out  but he managed it  he found
the manhole and slithered  drinking great draughts of air  down the
outside of the sphere  slipped in mud  blessed the smell of it  and at
last raised the unaccustomed weight of his body to its feet  he stood in
pitch-black night under torrential rain  with every pore of his body he
drank it in  with every desire of his heart he embraced the smell of the
field about him—a patch of his native planet where grass grew  where cows
moved  where presently he would come to hedges and a gate 

he had walked about half an hour when a vivid light behind him and a
strong  momentary wind informed him that the space-ship was no more  he
felt very little interest  he had seen dim lights  the lights of men 
ahead  he contrived to get into a lane  then into a road  then into a
village street  a lighted door was open  there were voices from within
and they were speaking english  there was a familiar smell  he pushed his
way in  regardless of the surprise he was creating  and walked to the
bar 

a pint of bitter  please  said ransom 




                               twenty-two


at this point  if i were guided by purely literary considerations  my
story would end  but it is time to remove the mask and to acquaint the
reader with the real and practical purpose for which this book has been
written  at the same time he will learn how the writing of it became
possible at all 

dr  ransom—and at this stage it will become obvious that that is not his
real name—soon abandoned the idea of his malacandrian dictionary and
indeed all idea of communicating his story to the world  he was ill for
several months  and when he recovered he found himself in considerable
doubt as to whether what he remembered had really occurred  it looked
very like a delusion produced by his illness  and most of his apparent
adventures could  he saw  be explained psychoanalytically  he did not
lean very heavily on this fact himself  for he had long since observed
that a good many real things in the fauna and flora of our own world
could be accounted for in the same way if you started with the assumption
that they were illusions  but he felt that if he himself half doubted his
own story  the rest of the world would disbelieve it completely  he
decided to hold his tongue  and there the matter would have rested but
for a very curious coincidence 

this is where i come into the story  i had known dr  ransom slightly for
several years and corresponded with him on literary and philological
subjects  though we very seldom met  it was  therefore  quite in the
usual order of things that i should write him a letter some months ago 
of which i will quote the relevant paragraph  it ran like this 


i am now working at the platonists of the twelfth century and
incidentally discovering that they wrote damnably difficult latin  in one
of them  bernardus silvestris  there is a word i should particularly like
your views on—the word  oyarses   it occurs in the description of a
voyage through the heavens  and an  oyarses  seems to be the
“intelligence” or tutelary spirit of a heavenly sphere  i e  in our
language  of a planet  i asked c  j  about it and he says it ought to be
 ousiarches   that  of course  would make sense  but i do not feel quite
satisfied  have you by any chance ever come across a word like  oyarses  
or can you hazard any guess as to what language it may be 


the immediate result of this letter was an invitation to spend a week-end
with dr  ransom  he told me his whole story  and since then he and i have
been almost continuously at work on the mystery  a good many facts  which
i have no intention of publishing at present  have fallen into our hands 
facts about planets in general and about mars in particular  facts about
mediæval platonists  and  not least in importance  facts about the
professor to whom i am giving the fictitious name of weston  a systematic
report of these facts might  of course  be given to the civilized world 
but that would almost certainly result in universal incredulity and in a
libel action from weston  at the same time  we both feel that we cannot
be silent  we are being daily confirmed in our belief that the  oyarses 
of mars was right when it said that the present celestial year was to
be a revolutionary one  that the long isolation of our own planet is
nearing its end  and that great doings are on foot  we have found reason
to believe that the mediæval platonists were living in the same celestial
year as ourselves—in fact  that it began in the twelfth century of our
era—and that the occurrence of the name oyarsa  latinized as  oyarses  
in bernardus silvestris is not an accident  and we have also
evidence—increasing almost daily—that weston  or the force or forces
behind weston  will play a very important part in the events of the
next few centuries  and  unless we prevent them  a very disastrous one 
we do not mean that they are likely to invade mars—our cry is not merely
hands off malacandra  the dangers to be feared are not planetary but
cosmic  or at least solar  and they are not temporal but eternal  more
than this it would be unwise to say 

it was dr  ransom who first saw that our only chance was to publish in
the form of  fiction  what would certainly not be listened to as fact  he
even thought—greatly overrating my literary powers—that this might have
the incidental advantage of reaching a wider public  and that  certainly 
it would reach a great many people sooner than weston  to my objection
that if accepted as fiction  it would for that very reason be regarded as
false  he replied that there would be indications enough in the narrative
for the few readers—the very few—who  at present  were prepared to go
further into the matter 

and they  he said  will easily find out you  or me  and will easily
identify weston  anyway  he continued  what we need for the moment is
not so much a body of belief as a body of people familiarized with
certain ideas  if we could even effect in one per cent  of our readers a
change-over from the conception of space to the conception of heaven  we
should have made a beginning 

what neither of us foresaw was the rapid march of events which was to
render the book out of date before it was published  these events have
already made it rather a prologue to our story than the story itself  but
we must let it go as it stands  for the later stages of the
adventure—well  it was aristotle  long before kipling  who taught us the
formula  that is another story 




                               postscript


   being extracts from a letter written by the original of dr  ransom
                            to the author   

      i think you are right  and after the two or three corrections
 marked in red  the ms  will have to stand  i wont deny that i am
disappointed  but then any attempt to tell such a story is bound to
disappoint the man who has really been there  i am not now referring to
the ruthless way in which you have cut down all the philological part 
though  as it now stands  we are giving our readers a mere caricature of
the malacandrian language  i mean something more difficult—something
which i couldnt possibly express  how can one get across the
malacandrian  smells   nothing comes back to me more vividly in my dreams
      especially the early morning smell in those purple woods  where the
very mention of early morning and woods is misleading because it must
set you thinking of earth and moss and cobwebs and the smell of our own
planet  but im thinking of something totally different  more aromatic
      yes  but then it is not hot or luxurious or exotic as that word
suggests  something aromatic  spicy  yet very cold  very thin  tingling
at the back of the nose—something that did to the sense of smell what
high  sharp violin notes do to the ear  and mixed with that i always hear
the sound of the singing—great hollow hound-like music from enormous
throats  deeper than chaliapin  a warm  dark noise  i am homesick for
my old malacandrian valley when i think of it  yet god knows when i heard
it there i was homesick enough for the earth 

of course you are right  if we are to treat it as a story you  must 
telescope the time i spent in the village during which nothing
happened  but i grudge it  those quiet weeks  the mere living among the
 hrossa   are to me the main thing that happened  i  know  them  lewis 
thats what you cant get into a mere story  for instance  because i
always take a thermometer with me on a holiday  it has saved many a one
from being spoiled  i know that the normal temperature of a  hross  is
103°  i know—though i cant remember learning it—that they live about 80
martian years  or 160 earth years  that they marry at about 20  = 40  
that their droppings  like those of the horse  are not offensive to
themselves  or to me  and are used for agriculture  that they dont shed
tears  or blink  that they do get  as you would say  elevated but not
drunk on a gaudy night—of which they have many  but what can one do with
these scraps of information  i merely analyse them out of a whole living
memory that can never be put into words  and no one in this world will be
able to build up from such scraps quite the right picture  for example 
can i make even you understand how i know  beyond all question  why it is
that the malacandrians dont keep pets and  in general  dont feel about
their lower animals as we do about ours  naturally it is the sort of
thing they themselves could never have told me  one just sees why when
one sees the three species together  each of them is to the others  both 
what a man is to us  and  what an animal is to us  they can talk to each
other  they can co-operate  they have the same ethics  to that extent a
 sorn  and a  hross  meet like two men  but then each finds the other
different  funny  attractive as an animal is attractive  some instinct
starved in us  which we try to soothe by treating irrational creatures
almost as if they were rational  is really satisfied in malacandra  they
dont need pets 

by the way  while we are on the subject of species  i am rather sorry
that the exigencies of the story have been allowed to simplify the
biology so much  did i give you the impression that each of the three
species was perfectly homogeneous  if so  i misled you  take the
 hrossa   my friends were black  hrossa   but there are also silver
 hrossa   and in some of the western  handramits  one finds the great
crested  hross —ten feet high  a dancer rather than a singer  and the
noblest animal  after man  that i have ever seen  only the males have the
crest  i also saw a pure white  hross  at meldilorn  but like a fool i
never found out whether he represented a sub-species or was a mere freak
like our terrestrial albino  there is also at least one other kind of
 sorn  besides the kind i saw—the  soroborn  or red  sorn  of the desert 
who lives in the sandy north  hes a corker by all accounts 

i agree  it is a pity i never saw the  pfifltriggi  at home  i know
nearly enough about them to fake a visit to them as an episode in the
story  but i dont think we ought to introduce any mere fiction  true in
substance sounds all very well on earth  but i cant imagine myself
explaining it to oyarsa  and i have a shrewd suspicion  see my last
letter  that i have not heard the end of  him   anyway  why should our
readers  you seem to know the devil of a lot about them   who are so
determined to hear nothing about the language  be so anxious to know more
of the  pfifltriggi   but if you can work it in  there is  of course  no
harm in explaining that they are oviparous and matriarchal  and
short-lived compared with the other species  it is pretty plain that the
great depressions which they inhabit are the old ocean-beds of
malacandra   hrossa   who had visited them  described themselves as going
down into deep forests over sand  the bone-stones  fossils  of ancient
wave-borers about them  no doubt these are the dark patches seen on the
martian disk from earth  and that reminds me—the maps of mars which i
have consulted since i got back are so inconsistent with one another that
i have given up the attempt to identify my own  handramit   if you want
to try your hand  the desideratum is a roughly north-east and south-west
“canal” cutting a north and south “canal” not more than twenty miles from
the equator  but astronomers differ very much as to what they can see 

now as to your most annoying question  did augray in describing the
 eldila   confuse the ideas of a subtler body and a superior being  no 
the confusion is entirely your own  he said two things  that the  eldila 
had bodies different from those of planetary animals  and that they were
superior in intelligence  neither he nor anyone else in malacandra ever
confused the one statement with the other or deduced the one from the
other  in fact  i have reasons for thinking that there are also
irrational animals with the  eldil  type of body  you remember chaucers
airish beasts   

i wonder are you wise to say nothing about the problem of  eldil  speech 
i agree that it would spoil the narrative to raise the question during
the trial-scene at meldilorn  but surely many readers will have enough
sense to ask how the  eldila   who obviously dont breathe  can talk  it
is true that we should have to admit we dont know  but oughtnt the
readers to be told that  i suggested to j —the only scientist here who is
in my confidence—your theory that they might have instruments  or even
organs  for manipulating the air around them and thus producing sounds
indirectly  but he didnt seem to think much of it  he thought it
probable that they directly manipulated the ears of those they were
speaking to  that sounds pretty difficult       of course one must
remember that we have really no knowledge of the shape or size of an
 eldil   or even of its relations to space   our  space  in general  in
fact  one wants to keep on insisting that we really know next to nothing
about them  like you  i cant help trying to fix their relation to the
things that appear in terrestrial tradition—gods  angels  fairies  but we
havent the data  when i attempted to give oyarsa some idea of our own
christian angelology  he certainly seemed to regard our angels as
different in some way from himself  but whether he meant that they were a
different species  or only that they were some special military caste
 since our poor old earth turns out to be a kind of ypres salient in the
universe   i dont know 

why must you leave out my account of how the shutter jammed just before
our landing on malacandra  without this  your description of our
sufferings from excessive light on the return journey raises the very
obvious question  why didnt they close their shutters  i dont believe
your theory that readers never notice that sort of thing  im sure i
should 

there are two scenes that i wish you could have worked into the book  no
matter—they are worked into me  one or other of them is always before me
when i close my eyes 

in one of them i see the malacandrian sky at morning  pale blue  so pale
that now  when i have grown once more accustomed to terrestrial skies  i
think of it as almost white  against it the nearer tops of the giant
weeds—the trees as you call them—show black  but far away  across miles
of that blinding blue water  the remoter woods are water-colour purple 
the shadows all around me on the pale forest-floor are like shadows on
snow  there are figures walking before me  slender yet gigantic forms 
black and sleek as animated tall hats  their huge round heads  poised on
their sinuous stalk-like bodies  give them the appearance of black
tulips  they go down  singing  to the edge of the lake  the music fills
the wood with its vibration  though it is so soft that i can hardly hear
it  it is like dim organ music  some of them embark  but most remain  it
is done slowly  this is no ordinary embarkation  but some ceremony  it
is  in fact  a  hross  funeral  those three with the grey muzzles whom
they have helped into the boat are going to meldilorn to die  for in that
world  except for some few whom the  hnakra  gets  no one dies before his
time  all live out the full span allotted to their kind  and a death with
them is as predictable as a birth with us  the whole village has known
that those three will die this year  this month  it was an easy guess
that they would die even this week  and now they are off  to receive the
last counsel of oyarsa  to die  and to be by him unbodied  the corpses 
as corpses  will exist only for a few minutes  there are no coffins in
malacandra  no sextons  churchyards  or undertakers  the valley is solemn
at their departure  but i see no signs of passionate grief  they do not
doubt their immortality  and friends of the same generation are not torn
apart  you leave the world  as you entered it  with the men of your own
year  death is not preceded by dread nor followed by corruption 

the other scene is a nocturne  i see myself bathing with hyoi in the warm
lake  he laughs at my clumsy swimming  accustomed to a heavier world  i
can hardly get enough of me under water to make any headway  and then i
see the night sky  the greater part of it is very like ours  though the
depths are blacker and the stars brighter  but something that no
terrestrial analogy will enable you fully to picture is happening in the
west  imagine the milky way magnified—the milky way seen through our
largest telescope on the clearest night  and then imagine this  not
painted across the zenith  but rising like a constellation behind the
mountain-tops—a dazzling necklace of lights brilliant as planets  slowly
heaving itself up till it fills a fifth of the sky and now leaves a belt
of blackness between itself and the horizon  it is too bright to look at
for long  but it is only a preparation  something else is coming  there
is a glow like moonrise on the  harandra    ahihra   cries hyoi  and
other baying voices answer him from the darkness all about us  and now
the true king of night is up  and now he is threading his way through
that strange western galaxy and making its lights dim by comparison with
his own  i turn my eyes away  for the little disk is far brighter than
the moon in her greatest splendour  the whole  handramit  is bathed in
colourless light  i could count the stems of the forest on the far side
of the lake  i see that my fingernails are broken and dirty  and now i
guess what it is that i have seen—jupiter rising beyond the asteroids and
forty million miles nearer than he has ever been to earthly eyes  but the
malacandrians would say within the asteroids  for they have an odd
habit  sometimes  of turning the solar system inside out  they call the
asteroids the dancers before the threshold of the great worlds  the
great worlds are the planets  as we should say  beyond or outside the
asteroids  glundandra  jupiter  is the greatest of these and has some
importance in malacandrian thought which i cannot fathom  he is the
centre  great meldilorn  throne and feast  they are  of course 
well aware that he is uninhabitable  at least by animals of the planetary
type  and they certainly have no pagan idea of giving a local habitation
to maleldil  but somebody or something of great importance is connected
with jupiter  as usual the  séroni  would know  but they never told me 
perhaps the best comment is in the author whom i mentioned to you  for
as it was well said of the great africanus that he was never less alone
than when alone  so  in our philosophy  no parts of this universal frame
are less to be called solitarie than those which the vulgar esteem most
solitarie  since the withdrawing of men and beasts signifieth but the
greater frequency of more excellent creatures 

more of this when you come  i am trying to read every old book on the
subject that i can hear of  now that weston has shut the door  the way
to the planets lies through the past  if there is to be any more
space-travelling  it will have to be time-travelling as well

                                preface


this story can be read by itself but is also a sequel to  out of the
silent planet  in which some account was given of ransoms adventures in
mars—or  as its inhabitants call it   malacandra   all the human
characters in this book are purely fictitious and none of them is
allegorical 

                                                              



                                  one


as i left the railway station at worchester and set out on the
three-mile walk to ransoms cottage  i reflected that no one on that
platform could possibly guess the truth about the man i was going to
visit  the flat heath which spread out before me  for the village lies
all behind and to the north of the station  looked an ordinary heath 
the gloomy five-oclock sky was such as you might see on any autumn
afternoon  the few houses and the clumps of red or yellowish trees were
in no way remarkable  who could imagine that a little farther on in that
quiet landscape i should meet and shake by the hand a man who had lived
and eaten and drunk in a world forty million miles distant from london 
who had seen this earth from where it looks like a mere point of green
fire  and who had spoken face to face with a creature whose life began
before our own planet was inhabitable 

for ransom had met other things in mars besides the martians  he had met
the creatures called  eldila   and specially that great eldil who is the
ruler of mars or  in their speech  the  oyarsa  of  malacandra   the
eldila are very different from any planetary creatures  their physical
organism  if organism it can be called  is quite unlike either the human
or the martian  they do not eat  breed  breathe  or suffer natural
death  and to that extent resemble thinking minerals more than they
resemble anything we should recognise as an animal  though they appear
on planets and may even seem to our senses to be sometimes resident in
them  the precise spatial location of an eldil at any moment presents
great problems  they themselves regard space  or “deep heaven”  as their
true habitat  and the planets are to them not closed worlds but merely
moving points—perhaps even interruptions—in what we know as the solar
system and they as the field of arbol 

at present i was going to see ransom in answer to a wire which had said
“come down thursday if possible  business ” i guessed what sort of
business he meant  and that was why i kept on telling myself that it
would be perfectly delightful to spend a night with ransom and also kept
on feeling that i was not enjoying the prospect as much as i ought to 
it was the eldila that were my trouble  i could just get used to the
fact that ransom had been to mars       but to have met an eldil  to
have spoken with something whose life appeared to be practically
unending        even the journey to mars was bad enough  a man who has
been in another world does not come back unchanged  one cant put the
difference into words  when the man is a friend it may become painful 
the old footing is not easy to recover  but much worse was my growing
conviction that  since his return  the eldila were not leaving him
alone  little things in his conversation  little mannerisms  accidental
allusions which he made and then drew back with an awkward apology  all
suggested that he was keeping strange company  that there were—well 
visitors—at that cottage 

as i plodded along the empty  unfenced road which runs across the middle
of worchester common i tried to dispel my growing sense of  malaise  by
analysing it  what  after all  was i afraid of  the moment i had put
this question i regretted it  i was shocked to find that i had mentally
used the word “afraid ” up till then i had tried to pretend that i was
feeling only distaste  or embarrassment  or even boredom  but the mere
word  afraid  had let the cat out of the bag  i realised now that my
emotion was neither more  nor less  nor other  than fear  and i realised
that i was afraid of two things—afraid that sooner or later i myself
might meet an eldil  and afraid that i might get “drawn in ” i suppose
every one knows this fear of getting “drawn in”—the moment at which a
man realises that what had seemed mere speculations are on the point of
landing him in the communist party or the christian church—the sense
that a door has just slammed and left him on the inside  the thing was
such sheer bad luck  ransom himself had been taken to mars  or
malacandra  against his will and almost by accident  and i had become
connected with his affair by another accident  yet here we were both
getting more and more involved in what i could only describe as
inter-planetary politics  as to my intense wish never to come into
contact with the eldila myself  i am not sure whether i can make you
understand it  it was something more than a prudent desire to avoid
creatures alien in kind  very powerful  and very intelligent  the truth
was that all i heard about them served to connect two things which ones
mind tends to keep separate  and that connecting gave one a sort of
shock  we tend to think about non-human intelligences in two distinct
categories which we label “scientific” and “supernatural” respectively 
we think  in one mood  of mr  wells martians  very unlike the real
malacandrians  by the bye   or his selenites  in quite a different mood
we let our minds loose on the possibility of angels  ghosts  fairies 
and the like  but the very moment we are compelled to recognise a
creature in either class as  real  the distinction begins to get
blurred  and when it is a creature like an eldil the distinction
vanishes altogether  these things were not animals—to that extent one
had to classify them with the second group  but they had some kind of
material vehicle whose presence could  in principle  be scientifically
verified  to that extent they belonged to the first group  the
distinction between natural and supernatural  in fact  broke down  and
when it had done so  one realised how great a comfort it had been—how it
had eased the burden of intolerable strangeness which this universe
imposes on us by dividing it into two halves and encouraging the mind
never to think of both in the same context  what price we may have paid
for this comfort in the way of false security and accepted confusion of
thought is another matter 

“this is a long  dreary road ” i thought to myself  “thank goodness i
havent anything to carry ” and then  with a start of realisation  i
remembered that i ought to be carrying a pack  containing my things for
the night  i swore to myself  i must have left the thing in the train 
will you believe me when i say that my immediate impulse was to turn
back to the station and “do something about it”  of course there was
nothing to be done which could not equally well be done by ringing up
from the cottage  that train  with my pack in it  must by this time be
miles away 

i realise that now as clearly as you do  but at the moment it seemed
perfectly obvious that i must retrace my steps  and i had indeed begun
to do so before reason or conscience awoke and set me once more plodding
forwards  in doing this i discovered more clearly than before how very
little i wanted to do it  it was such hard work that i felt as if i were
walking against a headwind  but in fact it was one of those still  dead
evenings when no twig stirs  and beginning to be a little foggy 

the farther i went the more impossible i found it to think about
anything except these eldila  what  after all  did ransom really know
about them  by his own account the sorts which he had met did not
usually visit our own planet—or had only begun to do so since his return
from mars  we had eldila of our own  he said  tellurian eldils  but they
were of a different kind and mostly hostile to man  that  in fact  was
why our world was cut off from communication with the other planets  he
described us as being in a state of siege  as being  in fact  an
enemy-occupied territory  held down by eldils who were at war both with
us and with the eldils of “deep heaven ” or “space ” like the bacteria
on the microscopic level  so these co-inhabiting pests on the
macroscopic permeate our whole life invisibly and are the real
explanation of that fatal bent which is the main lesson of history  if
all this were true  then  of course  we should welcome the fact that
eldila of a better kind had at last broken the frontier  it is  they
say  at the moons orbit  and were beginning to visit us  always
assuming that ransoms account was the correct one 

a nasty idea occurred to me  why should not ransom be a dupe  if
something from outer space were trying to invade our planet  what better
smoke-screen could it put up than this very story of ransoms  was there
the slightest evidence  after all  for the existence of the supposed
maleficent eldils on this earth  how if my friend were the unwitting
bridge  the trojan horse  whereby some possible invader were effecting
its landing on tellus  and then once more  just as when i had discovered
that i had no pack  the impulse to go no farther returned to me  “go
back  go back ” it whispered to me  “send him a wire  tell him you were
ill  say youll come some other time—anything ” the strength of the
feeling astonished me  i stood still for a few moments telling myself
not to be a fool  and when i finally resumed my walk i was wondering
whether this might be the beginning of a nervous breakdown  no sooner
had this idea occurred to me than it also became a new reason for not
visiting ransom  obviously  i wasnt fit for any such jumpy “business”
as his telegram almost certainly referred to  i wasnt even fit to spend
an ordinary week-end away from home  my only sensible course was to turn
back at once and get safe home  before i lost my memory or became
hysterical  and to put myself in the hands of a doctor  it was sheer
madness to go on 

i was now coming to the end of the heath and going down a small hill 
with a copse on my left and some apparently deserted industrial
buildings on my right  at the bottom the evening mist was partly thick 
“they call it a breakdown  at first  ” i thought  wasnt there some
mental disease in which quite ordinary objects looked to the patient
unbelievably ominous        looked  in fact  just as that abandoned
factory looks to me now  great bulbous shapes of cement  strange
brickwork bogeys  glowered at me over dry scrubby grass pock-marked with
grey pools and intersected with the remains of a light railway  i was
reminded of things which ransom had seen in that other world  only
there  they were people  long spindle-like giants whom he called sorns 
what made it worse was that he regarded them as good people—very much
nicer  in fact  than our own race  he was in league with them  how did i
know he was even a dupe  he might be something worse       and again i
came to a standstill 

the reader  not knowing ransom  will not understand how contrary to all
reason this idea was  the rational part of my mind  even at that moment 
knew perfectly well that even if the whole universe were crazy and
hostile  ransom was sane and wholesome and honest  and this part of my
mind in the end sent me forward—but with a reluctance and a difficulty i
can hardly put into words  what enabled me to go on was the knowledge
 deep down inside me  that i was getting nearer at every stride to the
one friend  but i  felt  that i was getting nearer to the one enemy—the
traitor  the sorcerer  the man in league with “them”       walking into
the trap with my eyes open  like a fool  “they call it a breakdown at
first ” said my mind  “and send you to a nursing home  later on they
move you to an asylum ”

i was past the dead factory now  down in the fog  where it was very
cold  then came a moment—the first one—of absolute terror and i had to
bite my lip to keep myself from screaming  it was only a cat that had
run across the road  but i found myself completely unnerved  “soon you
will really be screaming ” said my inner tormentor  “running round and
round  screaming  and you wont be able to stop it ”

there was a little empty house by the side of the road  with most of the
windows boarded up and one staring like the eye of a dead fish  please
understand that at ordinary times the idea of a “haunted house” means no
more to me than it does to you  no more  but also  no less  at that
moment it was nothing so definite as the thought of a ghost that came to
me  it was just the  word  “haunted ” “haunted”       “haunting”      
what a quality there is in that first syllable  would not a child who
had never heard the word before and did not know its meaning shudder at
the mere sound if  as the day was closing in  it heard one of its elders
say to another “this house is haunted” 

at last i came to the cross-roads by the little wesleyan chapel where i
had to turn to the left under the beech trees  i ought to be seeing the
lights from ransoms windows by now—or was it past black-out time  my
watch had stopped  and i didnt know  it was dark enough but that might
be due to the fog and the trees  it wasnt the dark i was afraid of  you
understand  we have all known times when inanimate objects seemed to
have almost a facial expression  and it was the expression of this bit
of road which i did not like  “its not true ” said my mind  “that
people who are really going mad never think theyre going mad ” suppose
that real insanity had chosen this place in which to begin  in that
case  of course  the black enmity of those dripping trees—their horrible
expectancy—would be a hallucination  but that did not make it any
better  to think that the spectre you see is an illusion does not rob
him of his terrors  it simply adds the further terror of madness
itself—and then on top of that the horrible surmise that those whom the
rest call mad have  all along  been the only people who see the world as
it really is 

this was upon me now  i staggered on into the cold and the darkness 
already half convinced that i must be entering what is called madness 
but each moment my opinion about sanity changed  had it ever been more
than a convention—a comfortable set of blinkers  an agreed mode of
wishful thinking  which excluded from our view the full strangeness and
malevolence of the universe we are compelled to inhabit  the things i
had begun to know during the last few months of my acquaintance with
ransom already amounted to more than “sanity” would admit  but i had
come much too far to dismiss them as unreal  i doubted his
interpretation  or his good faith  i did not doubt the existence of the
things he had met in mars—the pfifltriggi  the hrossa  and the sorns—nor
of these interplanetary eldila  i did not even doubt the reality of that
mysterious being whom the eldila call maleldil and to whom they appear
to give a total obedience such as no tellurian dictator can command  i
knew what ransom supposed maleldil to be 

surely that was the cottage  it was very well blacked-out  a childish 
whining thought arose on my mind  why was he not out at the gate to
welcome me  an even more childish thought followed it  perhaps he  was 
in the garden waiting for me  hiding  perhaps he would jump on me from
behind  perhaps i should see a figure that looked like ransom standing
with its back to me and when i spoke to it  it would turn round and show
a face that was not human at all       

i have naturally no wish to enlarge on this phase of my story  the state
of mind i was in was one which i look back on with humiliation  i would
have passed it over if i did not think that some account of it was
necessary for a full understanding of what follows—and  perhaps  of some
other things as well  at all events  i  cant  really describe how i
reached the front door of the cottage  somehow or other  despite the
loathing and dismay that pulled me back and a sort of invisible wall of
resistance that met me in the face  fighting for each step  and almost
shrieking as a harmless spray of the hedge touched my face  i managed to
get through the gate and up the little path  and there i was  drumming
on the door and wringing the handle and shouting to him to let me in as
if my life depended on it 

there was no reply—not a sound except the echo of the sounds i had been
making myself  there was only something white fluttering on the knocker 
i guessed  of course  that it was a note  in striking a match to read it
by  i discovered how very shaky my hands had become  and when the match
went out i realised how dark the evening had grown  after several
attempts i read the thing  “sorry  had to go up to cambridge  shant be
back till the late train  eatables in larder and bed made up in your
usual room  dont wait supper for me unless you feel like it—e  r ” and
immediately the impulse to retreat  which had already assailed me
several times  leaped upon me with a sort of demoniac violence  here was
my retreat left open  positively inviting me  now was my chance  if
anyone expected me to go into that house and sit there alone for several
hours  they were mistaken  but then  as the thought of the return
journey began to take shape in my mind  i faltered  the idea of setting
out to traverse the avenue of beech trees again  it was really dark now 
with this house behind me  one had the absurd feeling that it could
follow one  was not attractive  and then  i hope  something better came
into my mind—some rag of sanity and some reluctance to let ransom down 
at least i could try the door to see if it were really unlocked  i did 
and it was  next moment  i hardly know how  i found myself inside and
let it slam behind me 

it was quite dark  and warm  i groped a few paces forward  hit my shin
violently against something  and fell  i sat still for a few seconds
nursing my leg  i thought i knew the layout of ransoms
hall-sitting-room pretty well and couldnt imagine what i had blundered
into  presently i groped in my pocket  got out my matches  and tried to
strike a light  the head of the match flew off  i stamped on it and
sniffed to make sure it was not smouldering on the carpet  as soon as i
sniffed i became aware of a strange smell in the room  i could not for
the life of me make out what it was  it had an unlikeness to ordinary
domestic smells as great as that of some chemicals  but it was not a
chemical kind of smell at all  then i struck another match  it flickered
and went out almost at once—not unnaturally  since i was sitting on the
door-mat and there are few front doors even in better built houses than
ransoms country cottage which do not admit a draught  i had seen
nothing by it except the palm of my own hand hollowed in an attempt to
guard the flame  obviously i must get away from the door  i rose
gingerly and felt my way forward  i came at once to an
obstacle—something smooth and very cold that rose a little higher than
my knees  as i touched it i realised that it was the source of the
smell  i groped my way along this to the left and finally came to the
end of it  it seemed to present several surfaces and i couldnt picture
the shape  it was not a table  for it had no top  ones hand groped
along the rim of a kind of low wall—the thumb on the outside and the
fingers down inside the enclosed space  if it had felt like wood i
should have supposed it to be a large packing-case  but it was not wood 
i thought for a moment that it was wet  but soon decided that i was
mistaking coldness for moisture  when i reached the end of it i struck
my third match 

i saw something white and semi-transparent—rather like ice  a great big
thing  very long  a kind of box  an open box  and of a disquieting shape
which i did not immediately recognise  it was big enough to put a man
into  then i took a step back  lifting the lighted match higher to get a
more comprehensive view  and instantly tripped over something behind me 
i found myself sprawling in darkness  not on the carpet  but on more of
the cold substance with the odd smell  how many of the infernal things
were there 

i was just preparing to rise again and hunt systematically round the
room for a candle when i heard ransoms name pronounced  and almost  but
not quite  simultaneously i saw the thing i had feared so long to see  i
heard ransoms name pronounced  but i should not like to say i heard a
voice pronounce it  the sound was quite astonishingly unlike a voice  it
was perfectly articulate  it was even  i suppose  rather beautiful  but
it was  if you understand me  inorganic  we feel the difference between
animal voices  including those of the human animal  and all other noises
pretty clearly  i fancy  though it is hard to define  blood and lungs
and the warm  moist cavity of the mouth are somehow indicated in every
voice  here they were not  the two syllables sounded more as if they
were played on an instrument than as if they were spoken  and yet they
did not sound mechanical either  a machine is something we make out of
natural materials  this was more as if rock or crystal or light had
spoken of itself  and it went through me from chest to groin like the
thrill that goes through you when you think you have lost your hold
while climbing a cliff 

that was what i heard  what i saw was simply a very faint rod or pillar
of light  i dont think it made a circle of light either on the floor or
the ceiling  but i am not sure of this  it certainly had very little
power of illuminating its surroundings  so far  all is plain sailing 
but it had two other characteristics which are less easy to grasp  one
was its colour  since i saw the thing i must obviously have seen it
either white or coloured  but no efforts of my memory can conjure up the
faintest image of what that colour was  i try blue  and gold  and
violet  and red  but none of them will fit  how it is possible to have a
visual experience which immediately and ever after becomes impossible to
remember  i do not attempt to explain  the other was its angle  it was
not at right angles to the floor  but as soon as i have said this  i
hasten to add that this way of putting it is a later reconstruction 
what one actually felt at the moment was that the column of light was
vertical but the floor was not horizontal—the whole room seemed to have
heeled over as if it were on board ship  the impression  however
produced  was that this creature had reference to some horizontal  to
some whole system of directions  based outside the earth  and that its
mere presence imposed that alien system on me and abolished the
terrestrial horizontal 

i had no doubt at all that i was seeing an eldil  and little doubt that
i was seeing the archon of mars  the oyarsa of malacandra  and now that
the thing had happened i was no longer in a condition of abject panic 
my sensations were  it is true  in some ways very unpleasant  the fact
that it was quite obviously not organic—the knowledge that intelligence
was somehow located in this homogeneous cylinder of light but not
related to it as our consciousness is related to our brains and
nerves—was profoundly disturbing [1] it would not fit into our
categories  the response which we ordinarily make to a living creature
and that which we make to an inanimate object were here both equally
inappropriate  on the other hand  all those doubts which i had felt
before i entered the cottage as to whether these creatures were friend
or foe  and whether ransom were a pioneer or a dupe  had for the moment
vanished  my fear was now of another kind  i felt sure that the creature
was what we call “good ” but i wasnt sure whether i liked “goodness” so
much as i had supposed  this is a very terrible experience  as long as
what you are afraid of is something evil  you may still hope that the
good may come to your rescue  but suppose you struggle through to the
good and find that it also is dreadful  how if food itself turns out to
be the very thing you cant eat  and home the very place you cant live 
and your very comforter the person who makes you uncomfortable  then 
indeed  there is no rescue possible  the last card has been played  for
a second or two i was nearly in that condition  here at last was a bit
of that world from beyond the world  which i had always supposed that i
loved and desired  breaking through and appearing to my senses  and i
didnt like it  i wanted it to go away  i wanted every possible
distance  gulf  curtain  blanket  and barrier to be placed between it
and me  but i did not fall quite into the gulf  oddly enough my very
sense of helplessness saved me and steadied me  for now i was quite
obviously “drawn in ” the struggle was over  the next decision did not
lie with me 

then  like a noise from a different world  came the opening of the door
and the sound of boots on the doormat  and i saw  silhouetted against
the greyness of the night in the open doorway  a figure which i
recognised as ransom  the speaking which was not a voice came again out
of the rod of light  and ransom  instead of moving  stood still and
answered it  both speeches were in a strange polysyllabic language which
i had not heard before  i make no attempt to excuse the feelings which
awoke in me when i heard the unhuman sound addressing my friend and my
friend answering it in the unhuman language  they are  in fact 
inexcusable  but if you think they are improbable at such a juncture  i
must tell you plainly that you have read neither history nor your own
heart to much effect  they were feelings of resentment  horror  and
jealousy  it was in my mind to shout out  “leave your familiar alone 
you damned magician  and attend to me ”

what i actually said was  “oh  ransom  thank god youve come ”




                                  two


the door was slammed  for the second time that night  and after a
moments groping ransom had found and lit a candle  i glanced quickly
round and could see no one but ourselves  the most noticeable thing in
the room was the big white object  i recognised the shape well enough
this time  it was a large coffin-shaped casket  open  on the floor
beside it lay its lid  and it was doubtless this that i had tripped
over  both were made of the same white material  like ice  but more
cloudy and less shining 

“by jove  im glad to see you ” said ransom  advancing and shaking hands
with me  “id hoped to be able to meet you at the station  but
everything has had to be arranged in such a hurry and i found at the
last moment that id got to go up to cambridge  i never intended to
leave you to make  that  journey alone ” then  seeing  i suppose  that i
was still staring at him rather stupidly  he added  “i say—youre  all
right   arent you  you got through the barrage without any damage ”

“the barrage —i dont understand ”

“i was thinking you would have met some difficulties in getting here ”

“oh   that  ” said i  “you mean it wasnt just my nerves  there really
was something in the way ”

“yes  they didnt want you to get here  i was afraid something of the
sort might happen but there was no time to do anything about it  i was
pretty sure youd get through somehow ”

“by  they  you mean the others—our own eldila ”

“of course  theyve got wind of whats on hand       ”

i interrupted him  “to tell you the truth  ransom ” i said  “im getting
more worried every day about the whole business  it came into my head as
i was on my way here——”

“oh  theyll put all sorts of things into your head if you let them ”
said ransom lightly  “the best plan is to take no notice and keep
straight on  dont try to answer them  they like drawing you into an
interminable argument ”

“but  look here ” said i  “this isnt childs play  are you quite
certain that this dark lord  this depraved oyarsa of tellus  really
exists  do you know for certain either that there are two sides  or
which side is ours ”

he fixed me suddenly with one of his mild  but strangely formidable 
glances 

“you are in  real  doubt about either  are you ” he asked 

“no ” said i  after a pause  and felt rather ashamed 

“thats all right  then ” said ransom cheerfully  “now lets get some
supper and ill explain as we go along ”

“whats that coffin affair ” i asked as we moved into the kitchen 

“that is what im to travel in ”

“ransom ” i exclaimed  “he—it—the eldil—is not going to take you back to
malacandra ”

“dont ” said he  “oh  lewis  you dont understand  take me back to
malacandra  if only he would  id give anything i possess       just to
look down one of those gorges again and see the blue  blue water winding
in and out among the woods  or to be up on top—to see a sorn go gliding
along the slopes  or to be back there of an evening when jupiter was
rising  too bright to look at  and all the asteroids like a milky way 
with each star in it as bright as venus looks from earth  and the
smells  it is hardly ever out of my mind  youd expect it to be worse at
night when malacandra is up and i can actually see it  but it isnt then
that i get the real twinge  its on hot summer days—looking up at the
deep blue and that thinking that  in there   millions of miles deep
where i can never  never get back to it  theres a place i know  and
flowers at that very moment growing over meldilorn  and friends of mine 
going about their business  who would welcome me back  no  no such luck 
its not malacandra im being sent to  its perelandra ”

“thats what we call venus  isnt it ”

“yes ”

“and you say youre being sent ”

“yes  if you remember  before i left malacandra the oyarsa hinted to me
that my going there at all might be the beginning of a whole new phase
in the life of the solar system—the field of arbol  it might mean  he
said  that the isolation of our world  the siege  was beginning to draw
to an end ”

“yes  i remember ”

“well  it really does look as if something of the sort were afoot  for
one thing  the two sides  as you call them  have begun to appear much
more clearly  much less mixed  here on earth  in our own human
affairs—to show in something a little more like their true colours ”

“i see that all right ”

“the other thing is this  the black archon—our own bent oyarsa—is
meditating some sort of attack on perelandra ”

“but is he at large like that in the solar system  can he get there ”

“thats just the point  he cant get there in his own person  in his own
photosome or whatever we should call it  as you know  he was driven back
within these bounds centuries before any human life existed on our
planet  if he ventured to show himself outside the moons orbit hed be
driven back again—by main force  that would be a different kind of war 
you or i could contribute no more to it than a flea could contribute to
the defence of moscow  no  he must be attempting perelandra in some
different way ”

“and where do you come in ”

“well—simply ive been ordered there ”

“by the—by oyarsa  you mean ”

“no  the order comes from much higher up  they all do  you know  in the
long run ”

“and what have you got to do when you get there ”

“i havent been told ”

“you are just part of the oyarsas  entourage  ”

“oh no  he isnt going to be there  he is to transport me to venus—to
deliver me there  after that  as far as i know  i shall be alone ”

“but  look here  ransom—i mean      ” my voice trailed away 

“i know ” said he with one of his singularly disarming smiles  “you are
feeling the absurdity of it  dr  elwin ransom setting out single-handed
to combat powers and principalities  you may even be wondering if ive
got megalomania ”

“i didnt mean that quite ” said i 

“oh  but i think you did  at any rate that is what i have been feeling
myself ever since the thing was sprung on me  but when you come to think
of it  is it odder than what all of us have to do every day  when the
bible used that very expression about fighting with principalities and
powers and depraved hyper-somatic beings at great heights  our
translation is very misleading at that point  by the way  it meant that
quite ordinary people were to do the fighting ”

“oh  i dare say ” said i  “but thats rather different  that refers to a
moral conflict ”

ransom threw back his head and laughed  “oh  lewis  lewis ” he said 
“you are inimitable  simply inimitable ”

“say what you like  ransom  there  is  a difference ”

“yes  there is  but not a difference that makes it megalomania to think
that any of us might have to fight either way  ill tell you how i look
at it  havent you noticed how in our own little war here on earth 
there are different phases  and while any one phase is going on people
get into the habit of thinking and behaving as if it was going to be
permanent  but really the thing is changing under your hands all the
time  and neither your assets nor your dangers this year are the same as
the year before  now your idea that ordinary people will never have to
meet the dark eldila in any form except a psychological or moral form—as
temptations or the like—is simply an idea that held good for a certain
phase of the cosmic war  the phase of the great siege  the phase which
gave to our planet its name of thulcandra  the  silent  planet  but
supposing that phase is passing  in the next phase it may be anyones
job to meet them       well  in some quite different mode ”

“i see ”

“dont imagine ive been selected to go to perelandra because im anyone
in particular  one never can see  or not till long afterwards  why  any 
one was selected for  any  job  and when one does  it is usually some
reason that leaves no room for vanity  certainly  it is never for what
the man himself would have regarded as his chief qualifications  i
rather fancy i am being sent because those two blackguards who kidnapped
me and took me to malacandra  did something which they never intended 
namely  gave a human being a chance to learn that language ”

“what language do you mean ”

“ hressa-hlab   of course  the language i learned in malacandra ”

“but surely you dont imagine they will speak the same language on
venus ”

“didnt i tell you about that ” said ransom  leaning forward  we were
now at table and had nearly finished our cold meat and beer and tea 
“im surprised i didnt  for i found out two or three months ago  and
scientifically it is one of the most interesting things about the whole
affair  it appears we were quite mistaken in thinking  hressa-hlab  the
peculiar speech of mars  it is really what may be called old solar 
 hlab-eribol-ef-cordi  ”

“what on earth do you mean ”

“i mean that there was originally a common speech for all rational
creatures inhabiting the planets of our system  those that were ever
inhabited  i mean—what the eldils call the low worlds  most of them  of
course  have never been inhabited and never will be  at least not what
wed call inhabited  that original speech was lost on thulcandra  our
own world  when our whole tragedy took place  no human language now
known in the world is descended from it ”

“but what about the other two languages on mars ”

“i admit i dont understand about them  one thing i do know  and i
believe i could prove it on purely philological grounds  they are
incomparably less ancient than  hressa-hlab   specially  surnibur   the
speech of the sorns  i believe it could be shown that  surnibur  is  by
malacandrian standards  quite a modern development  i doubt if its birth
can be put further back than a date which would fall within our cambrian
period ”

“and you think you will find  hressa-hlab   or old solar  spoken on
venus ”

“yes  i shall arrive knowing the language  it saves a lot of
trouble—though  as a philologist i find it rather disappointing ”

“but youve no idea what you are to do  or what conditions you will
find ”

“no idea at all what im to do  there are jobs  you know  where it is
essential that one should  not  know too much beforehand       things
one might have to say which one couldnt say effectively if one had
prepared them  as to conditions  well  i dont know much  it will be
warm  im to go naked  our astronomers dont know anything about the
surface of perelandra at all  the outer layer of her atmosphere is too
thick  the main problem  apparently  is whether she revolves on her own
axis or not  and at what speed  there are two schools of thought 
theres a man called schiaparelli who thinks she revolves once on
herself in the same time it takes her to go once round arbol—i mean  the
sun  the other people think she revolves on her own axis once in every
twenty-three hours  thats one of the things i shall find out ”

“if schiaparelli is right thered be perpetual day on one side of her
and perpetual night on the other ”

he nodded  musing  “itd be a funny frontier ” he said presently  “just
think of it  youd come to a county of eternal twilight  getting colder
and darker every mile you went  and then presently you wouldnt be able
to go further because thered be no more air  i wonder can you stand in
the day  just on the right side of the frontier  and look  into  the
night which you can never reach  and perhaps see a star or two—the only
place you  could  see them  for of course in the day-lands they would
never be visible        of course if they have a scientific civilisation
they may have diving-suits or things like submarines on wheels for going
into the night ”

his eyes sparkled  and even i  who had been mainly thinking of how i
should miss him and wondering what chances there were of my ever seeing
him again  felt a vicarious thrill of wonder and of longing to know 
presently he spoke again 

“you havent yet asked me where  you  come in ” he said 

“do you mean im to go too ” said i  with a thrill of exactly the
opposite kind 

“not at all  i mean you are to pack me up  and to stand by to unpack me
when i return—if all goes well ”

“pack you  oh  id forgotten about that coffin affair  ransom  how on
earth are you going to travel in that thing  whats the motive power 
what about air—and food—and water  theres only just room for you to lie
in it ”

“the oyarsa of malacandra himself will be the motive power  he will
simply move it to venus  dont ask me how  i have no idea what organs or
instruments they use  but a creature who has kept a planet in its orbit
for several billions of years will be able to manage a packing-case ”

“but what will you eat  how will you breathe ”

“he tells me i shall need to do neither  i shall be in some state of
suspended animation  as far as i can make out  i cant understand him
when he tries to describe it  but thats his affair ”

“do you feel quite happy about it ” said i  for a sort of horror was
beginning once more to creep over me 

“if you mean  does my reason accept the view that he will  accidents
apart  deliver me safe on the surface of perelandra —the answer is yes ”
said ransom  “if you mean  do my nerves and my imagination respond to
this view —im afraid the answer is no  one can believe in anæsthetics
and yet feel in a panic when they actually put the mask over your face 
i think i feel as a man who believes in the future life feels when he is
taken out to face a firing party  perhaps its good practice ”

“and im to pack you into that accursed thing ” said i 

“yes ” said ransom  “thats the first step  we must get out into the
garden as soon as the sun is up and point it so that there are no trees
or buildings in the way  across the cabbage bed will do  then i get
in—with a bandage across my eyes  for those walls wont keep out all the
sunlight once im beyond the air—and you screw me down  after that  i
think youll just see it glide off ”

“and then ”

“well  then comes the difficult part  you must hold yourself in
readiness to come down here again the moment you are summoned  to take
off the lid and let me out when i return ”

“when do you expect to return ”

“nobody can say  six months—a year—twenty years  thats the trouble  im
afraid im laying a pretty heavy burden on you ”

“i might be dead ”

“i know  im afraid part of your burden is to select a successor  at
once  too  there are four or five people whom we can trust ”

“what will the summons be ”

“oyarsa will give it  it wont be mistakable for anything else  you
neednt bother about that side of it  one other point  ive no
particular reason to suppose i shall come back wounded  but just in
case—if you can find a doctor whom we can let into the secret  it might
be just as well to bring him with you when you come down to let me out ”

“would humphrey do ”

“the very man  and now for some more personal matters  ive had to leave
you out of my will  and id like you to know why ”

“my dear chap  i never thought about your will till this moment ”

“of course not  but id like to have left you something  the reason i
havent  is this  im going to disappear  it is possible i may not come
back  its just conceivable there might be a murder trial  and if so one
cant be too careful  i mean  for your sake  and now for one or two
other private arrangements ”

we laid our heads together and for a long time we talked about those
matters which one usually discusses with relatives and not with friends 
i got to know a lot more about ransom than i had known before  and from
the number of odd people whom he recommended to my care  “if ever i
happened to be able to do anything ” i came to realise the extent and
intimacy of his charities  with every sentence the shadow of approaching
separation and a kind of graveyard gloom began to settle more
emphatically upon us  i found myself noticing and loving all sorts of
little mannerisms and expressions in him such as we notice always in a
woman we love  but notice in a man only as the last hours of his leave
run out or the date of the probably fatal operation draws near  i felt
our natures incurable incredulity  and could hardly believe that what
was now so close  so tangible and  in a sense  so much at my command 
would in a few hours be wholly inaccessible  an image—soon  even an
elusive image—in my memory  and finally a sort of shyness fell between
us because each knew what the other was feeling  it had got very cold 

“we must be going soon ” said ransom 

“not till he—the oyarsa—comes back ” said i—though  indeed  now that the
thing was so near i wished it to be over 

“he has never left us ” said ransom  “he has been in the cottage all the
time ”

“you mean he has been waiting in the next room all these hours ”

“not waiting  they never have that experience  you and i are conscious
of waiting  because we have a body that grows tired or restless  and
therefore a sense of cumulative duration  also we can distinguish duties
and spare time and therefore have a conception of leisure  it is not
like that with him  he has been here all this time  but you can no more
call it  waiting  than you can call the whole of his existence
 waiting   you might as well say that a tree in a wood was waiting  or
the sunlight waiting on the side of a hill ” ransom yawned  “im tired ”
he said  “and so are you  i shall sleep well in that coffin of mine 
come  let us lug it out ”

we went into the next room and i was made to stand before the
featureless flame which did not wait but just was  and there  with
ransom as our interpreter  i was in some fashion presented and with my
own tongue sworn in to this great business  then we took down the
black-out and let in the grey  comfortless morning  between us we
carried out the casket and the lid  so cold they seemed to burn our
fingers  there was a heavy dew on the grass and my feet were soaked
through at once  the eldil was with us  outside there  on the little
lawn  hardly visible to my eyes at all in the daylight  ransom showed me
the clasps of the lid and how it was to be fastened on  and then there
was some miserable hanging about  and then the final moment when he went
back into the house and reappeared  naked  a tall  white  shivering 
weary scarecrow of a man at that pale  raw hour  when he had got into
the hideous box he made me tie a thick black bandage round his eyes and
head  then he lay down  i had no thoughts of the planet venus now and no
real belief that i should see him again  if i had dared i would have
gone back on the whole scheme  but the other thing—the creature that did
not wait—was there  and the fear of it was upon me  with feelings that
have since often returned to me in nightmare i fastened the cold lid
down on top of the living man and stood back  next moment i was alone  i
didnt see how it went  i went back indoors and was sick  a few hours
later i shut up the cottage and returned to oxford 

then the months went past and grew to a year and a little more than a
year  and we had raids and bad news and hopes deferred and all the earth
became full of darkness and cruel habitations  till the night when
oyarsa came to me again  after that there was a journey in haste for
humphrey and me  standings in crowded corridors and waitings at small
hours on windy platforms  and finally the moment when we stood in clear
early sunlight in the little wilderness of deep weeds which ransoms
garden had now become and saw a black speck against the sunrise and
then  almost silently  the casket had glided down between us  we flung
ourselves upon it and had the lid off in about a minute and a half 

“good god  all smashed to bits ” i cried at my first glance of the
interior 

“wait a moment ” said humphrey  and as he spoke the figure in the coffin
began to stir and then sat up  shaking off as it did so a mass of red
things which had covered its head and shoulders and which i had
momentarily mistaken for ruin and blood  as they streamed off him and
were caught in the wind i perceived them to be flowers  he blinked for a
second or so  then called us by our names  gave each of us a hand  and
stepped out on the grass 

“how are you both ” he said  “youre looking rather knocked up ”

i was silent for a moment  astonished at the form which had risen from
that narrow house—almost a new ransom  glowing with health and rounded
with muscle and seemingly ten years younger  in the old days he had been
beginning to show a few grey hairs  but now the beard which swept his
chest was pure gold 

“hullo  youve cut your foot ” said humphrey  and i saw now that ransom
was bleeding from the heel 

“ugh  its cold down here ” said ransom  “i hope youve got the boiler
going and some hot water—and some clothes ”

“yes ” said i  as we followed him into the house  “humphrey thought of
all that  im afraid i shouldnt have ”

ransom was now in the bathroom  with the door open  veiled in clouds of
steam  and humphrey and i were talking to him from the landing  our
questions were more numerous than he could answer 

“that idea of schiaparellis is all wrong ” he shouted  “they have an
ordinary day and night there ” and “no  my heel doesnt hurt—or  at
least  its only just begun to ” and “thanks  any old clothes  leave
them on the chair” and “no thanks  i dont somehow feel like bacon or
eggs or anything of that kind  no fruit  you say  oh well  no matter 
bread or porridge or something” and “ill be down in five minutes now ”

he kept on asking if we were really all right and seemed to think we
looked ill  i went down to get the breakfast  and humphrey said he would
stay and examine and dress the cut on ransoms heel  when he rejoined me
i was looking at one of the red petals which had come in the casket 

“thats rather a beautiful flower ” said i  handing it to him 

“yes ” said humphrey  studying it with the hands and eyes of a
scientist  “what extraordinary delicacy  it makes an english violet seem
like a coarse weed ”

“lets put some of them in water ”

“not much good  look—its withered already ”

“how do you think he is ”

“tip-top in general  but i dont quite like that heel  he says the
hæmorrhage has been going on for a long time ”

ransom joined us  fully dressed  and i poured out the tea  and all that
day and far into the night he told us the story that follows 




                                 three


what it is like to travel in a celestial coffin was a thing that ransom
never described  he said he couldnt  but odd hints about that journey
have come out at one time or another when he was talking of quite
different matters 

according to his own account he was not what we call conscious  and yet
at the same time the experience was a very positive one with a quality
of its own  on one occasion  someone had been talking about “seeing
life” in the popular sense of knocking about the world and getting to
know people  and b  who was present  and who is an anthroposophist  said
something i cant quite remember about “seeing life” in a very different
sense  i think he was referring to some system of meditation which
claimed to make “the form of life itself” visible to the inner eye  at
any rate ransom let himself in for a long cross-examination by failing
to conceal the fact that he attached some very definite idea to this  he
even went so far—under extreme pressure—as to say that life appeared to
him  in that condition  as a “coloured shape ” asked “what colour ” he
gave a curious look and could only say “what colours  yes  what
colours ” but then he spoiled it all by adding  “of course it wasnt
colour at all really  i mean  not what wed call colour ” and shutting
up completely for the rest of the evening  another hint came out when a
sceptical friend of ours called mcphee was arguing against the christian
doctrine of the resurrection of the human body  i was his victim at the
moment and he was pressing on me in his scots way with such questions as
“so you think youre going to have guts and palate for ever in a world
where therell be no eating  and genital organs in a world without
copulation  man  yell have a grand time of it ” when ransom suddenly
burst out with great excitement  “oh  dont you see  you ass  that
theres a difference between a trans-sensuous life and a non-sensuous
life ” that  of course  directed mcphees fire to him  what emerged was
that in ransoms opinion the present functions and appetites of the body
would disappear  not because they were atrophied but because they were 
as he said “engulfed ” he used the word “trans-sexual” i remember and
began to hunt about for some similar words to apply to eating  after
rejecting “trans-gastronomic”   and since he was not the only
philologist present  that diverted the conversation into different
channels  but i am pretty sure he was thinking of something he had
experienced on his voyage to venus  but perhaps the most mysterious
thing he ever said about it was this  i was questioning him on the
subject—which he doesnt often allow—and had incautiously said  “of
course i realise its all rather too vague for you to put into words ”
when he took me up rather sharply  for such a patient man  by saying 
“on the contrary  it is words that are vague  the reason why the thing
cant be expressed is that its too  definite  for language ” and that
is about all i can tell you of his journey  one thing is certain  that
he came back from venus even more changed than he had come back from
mars  but of course that may have been because of what happened to him
after his landing 

to that landing  as ransom narrated it to me  i will now proceed  he
seems to have been awakened  if that is the right word  from his
indescribable celestial state by the sensation of falling—in other
words  when he was near enough to venus to feel venus as something in
the downward direction  the next thing he noticed was that he was very
warm on one side and very cold on the other  though neither sensation
was so extreme as to be really painful  anyway  both were soon swallowed
up in the prodigious white light from below which began to penetrate
through the semi-opaque walls of the casket  this steadily increased and
became distressing in spite of the fact that his eyes were protected 
there is no doubt this was the  albedo   the outer veil of very dense
atmosphere with which venus is surrounded and which reflects the suns
rays with intense power  for some obscure reason he was not conscious 
as he had been on his approach to mars  of his own rapidly increasing
weight  when the white light was just about to become unbearable  it
disappeared altogether  and very soon after the cold on his left side
and the heat on his right began to decrease and to be replaced by an
equable warmth  i take it he was now in the outer layer of the
perelandrian atmosphere—at first in a pale  and later in a tinted 
twilight  the prevailing colour  as far as he could see through the
sides of the casket  was golden or coppery  by this time he must have
been very near the surface of the planet  with the length of the casket
at right angles to that surface—falling feet downwards like a man in a
lift  the sensation of falling—helpless as he was and unable to move his
arms—became frightening  then suddenly there came a great green
darkness  an unidentifiable noise—the first message from the new
world—and a marked drop in temperature  he seemed now to have assumed a
horizontal position and also  to his great surprise  to be moving not
downwards but upwards  though  at the moment  he judged this to be an
illusion  all this time he must have been making faint  unconscious
efforts to move his limbs  for now he suddenly found that the sides of
his prison-house yielded to pressure  he  was  moving his limbs 
encumbered with some viscous substance  where was the casket  his
sensations were very confused  sometimes he seemed to be falling 
sometimes to be soaring upwards  and then again to be moving in the
horizontal plane  the viscous substance was white  there seemed to be
less of it every moment       white  cloudy stuff just like the casket 
only not solid  with a horrible shock he realised that it  was  the
casket  the casket melting  dissolving away  giving place to an
indescribable confusion of colour—a rich  varied world in which nothing 
for the moment  seemed palpable  there was no casket now  he was turned
out—deposited—solitary  he was in perelandra 

his first impression was of nothing more definite than of something
slanted—as though he were looking at a photograph which had been taken
when the camera was not held level  and even this lasted only for an
instant  the slant was replaced by a different slant  then two slants
rushed together and made a peak  and the peak flattened suddenly into a
horizontal line  and the horizontal line tilted and became the edge of a
vast gleaming slope which rushed furiously towards him  at the same
moment he felt that he was being lifted  up and up he soared till it
seemed as if he must reach the burning dome of gold that hung above him
instead of a sky  then he was at a summit  but almost before his glance
had taken in a huge valley that yawned beneath him—shining green like
glass and marbled with streaks of scummy white—he was rushing down into
that valley at perhaps thirty miles an hour  and now he realised that
there was a delicious coolness over every part of him except his head 
that his feet rested on nothing  and that he had for some time been
performing unconsciously the actions of a swimmer  he was riding the
foamless swell of an ocean  fresh and cool after the fierce temperatures
of heaven  but warm by earthly standards—as warm as a shallow bay with
sandy bottom in a sub-tropical climate  as he rushed smoothly up the
great convex hillside of the next wave he got a mouthful of the water 
it was hardly at all flavoured with salt  it was drinkable—like fresh
water and only  by an infinitesimal degree  less insipid  though he had
not been aware of thirst till now  his drink gave him a quite
astonishing pleasure  it was almost like meeting pleasure itself for the
first time  he buried his flushed face in the green translucence  and
when he withdrew it  found himself once more on the top of a wave 

there was no land in sight  the sky was pure  flat gold like the
background of a medieval picture  it looked very distant—as far off as a
cirrhus cloud looks from earth  the ocean was gold too  in the offing 
flecked with innumerable shadows  the nearer waves  though golden where
their summits caught the light  were green on their slopes  first
emerald  and lower down a lustrous bottle green  deepening to blue where
they passed beneath the shadow of other waves 

all this he saw in a flash  then he was speeding down once more into the
trough  he had somehow turned on his back  he saw the golden roof of
that world quivering with a rapid variation of paler lights as a ceiling
quivers at the reflected sunlight from the bath-water when you step into
your bath on a summer morning  he guessed that this was the reflection
of the waves wherein he swam  it is a phenomenon observable three days
out of five in the planet of love  the queen of those seas views herself
continually in a celestial mirror 

up again to the crest  and still no sight of land  something that looked
like clouds—or could it be ships —far away on his left  then down  down 
down—he thought he would never reach the end of it       this time he
noticed how dim the light was  such tepid revelry in water—such glorious
bathing  as one would have called it on earth  suggested as its natural
accompaniment a blazing sun  but here there was no such thing  the water
gleamed  the sky burned with gold  but all was rich and dim  and his
eyes fed upon it undazzled and unaching  the very names of green and
gold  which he used perforce in describing the scene  are too harsh for
the tenderness  the muted iridescence  of that warm  maternal 
delicately gorgeous world  it was mild to look upon as evening  warm
like summer noon  gentle and winning like early dawn  it was altogether
pleasurable  he sighed 

there was a wave ahead of him now so high that it was dreadful  we speak
idly in our own world of seas mountain high when they are not much more
than mast high  but this was the real thing  if the huge shape had been
a hill of land and not of water he might have spent a whole forenoon or
longer walking the slope before he reached the summit  it gathered him
into itself and hurled him up to that elevation in a matter of seconds 
but before he reached the top  he almost cried out in terror  for this
wave had not a smooth top like the others  a horrible crest appeared 
jagged and billowy and fantastic shapes  unnatural  even unliquid  in
appearance  sprouted from the ridge  rocks  foam  beasts  the question
hardly had time to flash through his mind before the thing was upon him 
involuntarily he shut his eyes  then he found himself once more rushing
downhill  whatever it was  it had gone past him  but it had been
something  he had been struck in the face  dabbing with his hands he
found no blood  he had been struck by something soft which did him no
harm but merely stung like a lash because of the speed at which he met
it  he turned round on his back again—already  as he did so  soaring
thousands of feet aloft to the high water of the next ridge  far down
below him in a vast  momentary valley he saw the thing that had missed
him  it was an irregularly shaped object with many curves and
re-entrants  it was variegated in colour like a patch-work
quilt—flame-colour  ultramarine  crimson  orange  gamboge  and violet 
he could not say more about it for the whole glimpse lasted so short a
time  whatever the thing was  it was floating  for it rushed up the
slope of the opposite wave and over the summit and out of sight  it sat
to the water like a skin  curving as the water curved  it took the
waves shape at the top  so that for a moment half of it was already out
of sight beyond the ridge and the other half still lying on the hither
slope  it behaved rather like a mat of weeds on a river—a mat of weeds
that takes on every contour of the little ripples you make by rowing
past it—but on a very different scale  this thing might have been thirty
acres or more in area 

words are slow  you must not lose sight of the fact that his whole life
on venus up till now had lasted less than five minutes  he was not in
the least tired  and not yet seriously alarmed as to his power of
surviving in such a world  he had confidence in those who had sent him
there  and for the meantime the coolness of the water and the freedom of
his limbs were still a novelty and a delight  but more than all these
was something else at which i have already hinted and which can hardly
be put into words—the strange sense of excessive pleasure which seemed
somehow to be communicated to him through all his senses at once  i use
the word “excessive” because ransom himself could only describe it by
saying that for his first few days on perelandra he was haunted  not by
a feeling of guilt  but by surprise that he had no such feeling  there
was an exuberance or prodigality of sweetness about the mere act of
living which our race finds it difficult not to associate with forbidden
and extravagant actions  yet it is a violent world too  hardly had he
lost sight of the floating object when his eyes were stabbed by an
unendurable light  a grading  blue-to-violet illumination made the
golden sky seem dark by comparison and in a moment of time revealed more
of the new planet than he had yet seen  he saw the waste of waves spread
illimitably before him  and far  far away  at the very end of the world 
against the sky  a single smooth column of ghastly green standing up 
the one thing fixed and vertical in this universe of shifting slopes 
then the rich twilight rushed back  now seeming almost darkness  and he
heard thunder  but it has a different  timbre  from terrestrial thunder 
more resonance  and even  when distant  a kind of tinkling  it is the
laugh  rather than the roar  of heaven  another flash followed  and
another  and then the storm was all about him  enormous purple clouds
came driving between him and the golden sky  and with no preliminary
drops a rain such as he had never experienced began to fall  there were
no lines in it  the water above him seemed only less continuous than the
sea  and he found it difficult to breathe  the flashes were incessant 
in between them  when he looked in any direction except that of the
clouds  he saw a completely changed world  it was like being at the
centre of a rainbow  or in a cloud of multi-coloured steam  the water
which now filled the air was turning sea and sky into a bedlam of
flaming and writhing transparencies  he was dazzled and now for the
first time a little frightened  in the flashes he saw  as before  only
the endless sea and the still green column at the end of the world  no
land anywhere—not the suggestion of a shore from one horizon to the
other 

the thunder was ear-splitting and it was difficult to get enough air 
all sorts of things seemed to be coming down in the rain—living things
apparently  they looked like preternaturally airy and graceful
frogs—sublimated frogs—and had the colour of dragon-flies  but he was in
no plight to make careful observations  he was beginning to feel the
first symptoms of exhaustion and was completely confused by the riot of
colours in the atmosphere  how long this state of affairs lasted he
could not say  but the next thing that he remembers noticing with any
accuracy was that the swell was decreasing  he got the impression of
being near the end of a range of water-mountains and looking down into
lower country  for a long time he never reached this lower country  what
had seemed  by comparison with the seas which he had met on his first
arrival  to be calm water  always turned out to be only slightly smaller
waves when he rushed down into them  there seemed to be a good many of
the big floating objects about  and these  again  from some distance
looked like an archipelago  but always  as he drew nearer and found the
roughness of the water they were riding  they became more like a fleet 
but in the end there was no doubt that the swell was subsiding  the rain
stopped  the waves were merely of atlantic height  the rainbow colours
grew fainter and more transparent and the golden sky first showed
timidly through them and then established itself again from horizon to
horizon  the waves grew smaller still  he began to breathe freely  but
he was now really tired  and beginning to find leisure to be afraid 

one of the great patches of floating stuff was sidling down a wave not
more than a few hundred yards away  he eyed it eagerly  wondering
whether he could climb on to one of these things for rest  he strongly
suspected that they would prove mere mats of weed  or the topmost
branches of submarine forests  incapable of supporting him  but while he
thought this  the particular one on which his eyes were fixed crept up a
wave and came between him and the sky  it was not flat  from its tawny
surface a whole series of feathery and billowy shapes arose  very
unequal in height  they looked darkish against the dim glow of the
golden roof  then they all tilted one way as the thing which carried
them curled over the crown of the water and dipped out of sight  but
here was another  not thirty yards away and bearing down on him  he
struck out towards it  noticing as he did so how sore and feeble his
arms were and feeling his first thrill of true fear  as he approached it
he saw that it ended in a fringe of undoubtedly vegetable matter  it
trailed  in fact  a dark red skirt of tubes and strings and bladders  he
grabbed at them and found he was not yet near enough  he began swimming
desperately  for the thing was gliding past him at some ten miles an
hour  he grabbed again and got a handful of whip-like red strings  but
they pulled out of his hand and almost cut him  then he thrust himself
right in among them  snatching wildly straight before him  for one
second he was in a kind of vegetable broth of gurgling tubes and
exploding bladders  next moment his hands caught something firmer ahead 
something almost like very soft wood  then  with the breath nearly
knocked out of him and a bruised knee  he found himself lying face
downward on a resistant surface  he pulled himself an inch or so
further  yes—there was no doubt now  one did not go through  it was
something one could lie on 

it seems that he must have remained lying on his face  doing nothing and
thinking nothing for a very long time  when he next began to take any
notice of his surroundings he was  at all events  well rested  his first
discovery was that he lay on a dry surface  which on examination turned
out to consist of something very like heather  except for the colour
which was coppery  burrowing idly with his fingers he found something
friable like dry soil  but very little of it  for almost at once he came
upon a base of tough interlocked fibres  then he rolled round on his
back  and in doing so discovered the extreme resilience of the surface
on which he lay  it was something much more than the pliancy of the
heather-like vegetation  and felt more as if the whole floating island
beneath that vegetation were a kind of mattress  he turned and looked
“inland”—if that is the right word—and for one instant what he saw
looked very like a country  he was looking up a long lonely valley with
a copper-coloured floor bordered on each side by gentle slopes clothed
in a kind of many-coloured forest  but even as he took this in  it
became a long copper-coloured ridge with the forest sloping  down  on
each side of it  of course he ought to have been prepared for this  but
he says that it gave him an almost sickening shock  the thing had
looked  in that first glance  so like a real country that he had
forgotten it was floating—an island if you like  with hills and valleys 
but hills and valleys which changed places every minute so that only a
cinematograph could make a contour map of it  and that is the nature of
the floating islands of perelandra  a photograph  omitting the colours
and the perpetual variation of shape  would make them look deceptively
like landscapes in our own world  but the reality is very different  for
they are dry and fruitful like land but their only shape is the
inconstant shape of the water beneath them  yet the land-like appearance
proved hard to resist  although he had now grasped with his brain what
was happening  ransom had not yet grasped it with his muscles and
nerves  he rose to take a few paces inland—and downhill  as it was at
the moment of his rising—and immediately found himself flung down on his
face  unhurt because of the softness of the weed  he scrambled to his
feet—saw that he now had a steep slope to ascend—and fell a second time 
a blessed relaxation of the strain in which he had been living since his
arrival dissolved him into weak laughter  he rolled to and fro on the
soft fragrant surface in a real schoolboy fit of the giggles 

this passed  and then for the next hour or two he was teaching himself
to walk  it was much harder than getting your sea-legs on a ship  for
whatever the sea is doing the deck of the ship remains a plane  but this
was like learning to walk on water itself  it took him several hours to
get a hundred yards away from the edge  or coast  of the floating
island  and he was proud when he could go five paces without a fall 
arms outstretched  knees bent in readiness for sudden change of balance 
his whole body swaying and tense like that of one who is learning to
walk the tight-rope  perhaps he would have learned more quickly if his
falls had not been so soft  if it had not been so pleasant  having
fallen  to lie still and gaze at the golden roof and hear the endless
soothing noise of the water and breathe in the curiously delightful
smell of the herbage  and then  too  it was so strange  after rolling
head over heels down into some little dell  to open his eyes and find
himself seated on the central mountain peak of the whole island looking
down like robinson crusoe on field and forest to the shores in every
direction  that a man could hardly help sitting there a few minutes
longer—and then being detained again because  even as he made to rise 
mountain and valley alike had been obliterated and the whole island had
become a level plain 

at long last he reached the wooded part  there was an undergrowth of
feathery vegetation  about the height of gooseberry bushes  coloured
like sea anemones  above this were the taller growths—strange trees with
tube-like trunks of grey and purple spreading rich canopies above his
head  in which orange  silver  and blue were the predominant colours 
here  with the aid of the tree trunks  he could keep his feet more
easily  the smells in the forest were beyond all that he had ever
conceived  to say that they made him feel hungry and thirsty would be
misleading  almost  they created a new kind of hunger and thirst  a
longing that seemed to flow over from the body into the soul and which
was a heaven to feel  again and again he stood still  clinging to some
branch to steady himself  and breathed it all in  as if breathing had
become a kind of ritual  and at the same time the forest landscape
furnished what would have been a dozen landscapes on earth—now level
wood with trees as vertical as towers  now a deep bottom where it was
surprising not to find a stream  now a wood growing on a hillside  and
now again  a hilltop whence one looked down through slanted boles at the
distant sea  save for the inorganic sound of waves there was utter
silence about him  the sense of his solitude became intense without
becoming at all painful—only adding  as it were  a last touch of
wildness to the unearthly pleasures that surrounded him  if he had any
fear now  it was a faint apprehension that his reason might be in
danger  there was something in perelandra that might overload a human
brain 

now he had come to a part of the wood where great globes of yellow fruit
hung from the trees—clustered as toy-balloons are clustered on the back
of the balloon-man and about the same size  he picked one of them and
turned it over and over  the rind was smooth and firm and seemed
impossible to tear open  then by accident one of his fingers punctured
it and went through into coldness  after a moments hesitation he put
the little aperture to his lips  he had meant to extract the smallest 
experimental sip  but the first taste put his caution all to flight  it
was  of course  a taste  just as his thirst and hunger had been thirst
and hunger  but then it was so different from every other taste that it
seemed mere pedantry to call it a taste at all  it was like the
discovery of a totally new  genus  of pleasures  something unheard of
among men  out of all reckoning  beyond all covenant  for one draught of
this on earth wars would be fought and nations betrayed  it could not be
classified  he could never tell us  when he came back to the world of
men  whether it was sharp or sweet  savoury or voluptuous  creamy or
piercing  “not like that” was all he could ever say to such inquiries 
as he let the empty gourd fall from his hand and was about to pluck a
second one  it came into his head that he was now neither hungry nor
thirsty  and yet to repeat a pleasure so intense and almost so spiritual
seemed an obvious thing to do  his reason  or what we commonly take to
be reason in our own world  was all in favour of tasting this miracle
again  the child-like innocence of fruit  the labours he had undergone 
the uncertainty of the future  all seemed to commend the action  yet
something seemed opposed to this “reason ” it is difficult to suppose
that this opposition came from desire  for what desire would turn from
so much deliciousness  but for whatever cause  it appeared to him better
not to taste again  perhaps the experience had been so complete that
repetition would be a vulgarity—like asking to hear the same symphony
twice in a day 

as he stood pondering over this and wondering how often in his life on
earth he had reiterated pleasures not through desire  but in the teeth
of desire and in obedience to a spurious rationalism  he noticed that
the light was changing  it was darker behind him than it had been 
ahead  the sky and sea shone through the wood with a changed intensity 
to step out of the forest would have been a minutes work on earth  on
this undulating island it took him longer  and when he finally emerged
into the open an extraordinary spectacle met his eyes  all day there had
been no variation at any point in the golden roof to mark the suns
position  but now the whole of one half-heaven revealed it  the orb
itself remained invisible  but on the rim of the sea rested an arc of
green so luminous that he could not look at it  and beyond that 
spreading almost to the zenith  a great fan of colour like a peacocks
tail  looking over his shoulder he saw the whole island ablaze with
blue  and across it and beyond it  even to the ends of the world  his
own enormous shadow  the sea  far calmer now than he had yet seen it 
smoked towards heaven in huge dolomites and elephants of blue and purple
vapour  and a light wind  full of sweetness  lifted the hair on his
forehead  the day was burning to death  each moment the waters grew more
level  something not far removed from silence began to be felt  he sat
down cross-legged on the edge of the island  the desolate lord  it
seemed  of this solemnity  for the first time it crossed his mind that
he might have been sent to an uninhabited world  and the terror added 
as it were  a razor-edge to all that profusion of pleasure 

once more  a phenomenon which reason might have anticipated took him by
surprise  to be naked yet warm  to wander among summer fruits and lie in
sweet heather—all this had led him to count on a twilit night  a mild
midsummer greyness  but before the great apocalyptic colours had died
out in the west  the eastern heaven was black  a few moments  and the
blackness had reached the western horizon  a little reddish light
lingered at the zenith for a time  during which he crawled back to the
woods  it was already  in common parlance  “too dark to see your way ”
but before he had lain down among the trees the real night had
come—seamless darkness  not like night but like being in a coal-cellar 
darkness in which his own hand held before his face was totally
invisible  absolute blackness  the undimensioned  the impenetrable 
pressed on his eyeballs  there is no moon in that land  no star pierces
the golden roof  but the darkness was warm  sweet new scents came
stealing out of it  the world had no size now  its boundaries were the
length and breadth of his own body and the little patch of soft
fragrance which made his hammock  swaying ever more and more gently 
night covered him like a blanket and kept all loneliness from him  the
blackness might have been his own room  sleep came like a fruit which
falls into the hand almost before you have touched the stem 




                                  four


at ransoms waking something happened to him which perhaps never happens
to a man until he is out of his own world  he saw reality  and thought
it was a dream  he opened his eyes and saw a strange heraldically
coloured tree loaded with yellow fruits and silver leaves  round the
base of the indigo stem was coiled a small dragon covered with scales of
red gold  he recognised the garden of the hesperides at once  “this is
the most vivid dream i have ever had ” he thought  by some means or
other he then realised that he was awake  but extreme comfort and some
trance-like quality  both in the sleep which had just left him and in
the experience to which he had awaked  kept him lying motionless  he
remembered how in the very different world called malacandra—that cold 
archaic world  as it now seemed to him—he had met the original of the
cyclops  a giant in a cave and a shepherd  were all the things which
appeared as mythology on earth scattered through other worlds as
realities  then the realisation came to him “you are in an unknown
planet  naked and alone  and that may be a dangerous animal ” but he was
not badly frightened  he knew that the ferocity of terrestrial animals
was  by cosmic standards  an exception  and had found kindness in
stranger creatures than this  but he lay quiet a little longer and
looked at it  it was a creature of the lizard type  about the size of a
st  bernard dog  with a serrated back  its eyes were open 

presently he ventured to rise on one elbow  the creature went on looking
at him  he noticed that the island was perfectly level  he sat up and
saw  between the stems of the trees  that they were in calm water  the
sea looked like gilded glass  he resumed his study of the dragon  could
this be a rational animal—a  hnau  as they said in malacandra—and the
very thing he had been sent there to meet  it did not look like one  but
it was worth trying  speaking in the old solar tongue he formed his
first sentence—and his own voice sounded to him unfamiliar 

“stranger ” he said  “i have been sent to your world through the heaven
by the servants of maleldil  do you give me welcome ”

the thing looked at him very hard and perhaps very wisely  then  for the
first time  it shut its eyes  this seemed an unpromising start  ransom
decided to rise to his feet  the dragon reopened its eyes  he stood
looking at it while you could count twenty  very uncertain how to
proceed  then he saw that it was beginning to uncoil itself  by a great
effort of will he stood his ground  whether the thing were rational or
irrational  flight could hardly help him for long  it detached itself
from the tree  gave itself a shake  and opened two shining reptilian
wings—bluish gold and bat-like  when it had shaken these and closed them
again  it gave ransom another long stare  and at last  half waddling and
half crawling  made its way to the edge of the island and buried its
long metallic-looking snout in the water  when it had drunk it raised
its head and gave a kind of croaking bleat which was not entirely
unmusical  then it turned  looked yet again at ransom  and finally
approached him  “its madness to  wait  for it ” said the false reason 
but ransom set his teeth and stood  it came right up and began nudging
him with its cold snout about his knees  he was in great perplexity  was
it rational and was this how it talked  was it irrational but
friendly—and if so  how should he respond  you could hardly stroke a
creature with scales  or was it merely scratching itself against him  at
that moment  with a suddenness which convinced him it was only a beast 
it seemed to forget all about him  turned away  and began tearing up the
herbage with great avidity  feeling that honour was now satisfied  he
also turned away back to the woods 

there were trees near him loaded with the fruit which he had already
tasted  but his attention was diverted by a strange appearance a little
farther off  amid the darker foliage of a greenish-grey thicket
something seemed to be sparkling  the impression  caught out of the
corner of his eye  had been that of a greenhouse roof with the sun on
it  now that he looked at it squarely it still suggested glass  but
glass in perpetual motion  light seemed to be coming and going in a
spasmodic fashion  just as he was moving to investigate this phenomenon
he was startled by a touch on his left leg  the beast had followed him 
it was once more nosing and nudging  ransom quickened his pace  so did
the dragon  he stopped  so did it  when he went on again it accompanied
him so closely that its side pressed against his thighs and sometimes
its cold  hard  heavy foot descended on his  the arrangement was so
little to his satisfaction that he was beginning to wonder seriously how
he could put an end to it when suddenly his whole attention was
attracted by something else  over his head there hung from a hairy
tube-like branch a great spherical object  almost transparent  and
shining  it held an area of reflected light in it and at one place a
suggestion of rainbow colouring  so this was the explanation of the
glass-like appearance in the wood  and looking round he perceived
innumerable shimmering globes of the same kind in every direction  he
began to examine the nearest one attentively  at first he thought it was
moving  then he thought it was not  moved by a natural impulse he put
out his hand to touch it  immediately his head  face  and shoulders were
drenched with what seemed  in that warm world  an ice-cold shower bath 
and his nostrils filled with a sharp  shrill  exquisite scent that
somehow brought to his mind the verse in pope  “die of a rose in
aromatic pain ” such was the refreshment that he seemed to himself to
have been  till now  but half awake  when he opened his eyes—which had
closed involuntarily at the shock of moisture—all the colours about him
seemed richer and the dimness of that world seemed clarified  a
re-enchantment fell upon him  the golden beast at his side seemed no
longer either a danger or a nuisance  if a naked man and a wise dragon
were indeed the sole inhabitants of this floating paradise  then this
also was fitting  for at that moment he had a sensation not of following
an adventure but of enacting a myth  to be the figure that he was in
this unearthly pattern appeared sufficient 

he turned again to the tree  the thing that had drenched him was quite
vanished  the tube or branch  deprived of its pendent globe  now ended
in a little quivering orifice from which there hung a bead of crystal
moisture  he looked round in some bewilderment  the grove was still full
of its iridescent fruit but now he perceived that there was a slow
continual movement  a second later he had mastered the phenomenon  each
of the bright spheres was very gradually increasing in size  and each 
on reaching a certain dimension  vanished with a faint noise  and in its
place there was a momentary dampness on the soil and a soon-fading 
delicious fragrance and coldness in the air  in fact  the things were
not fruit at all but bubbles  the trees  he christened them at that
moment  were bubble-trees  their life  apparently  consisted in drawing
up water from the ocean and then expelling it in this form  but enriched
by its short sojourn in their sappy inwards  he sat down to feed his
eyes upon the spectacle  now that he knew the secret he could explain to
himself why this wood looked and felt so different from every other part
of the island  each bubble  looked at individually  could be seen to
emerge from its parent-branch as a mere bead  the size of a pea  and
swell and burst  but looking at the wood as a whole  one was conscious
only of a continual faint disturbance of light  an elusive interference
with the prevailing perelandrian silence  an unusual coolness in the
air  and a fresher quality in the perfume  to a man born in our world it
felt a more out-door place than the open parts of the island  or even
the sea  looking at a fine cluster of the bubbles which hung above his
head he thought how easy it would be to get up and plunge oneself
through the whole lot of them and to feel  all at once  that magical
refreshment multiplied tenfold  but he was restrained by the same sort
of feeling which had restrained him over-night from tasting a second
gourd  he had always disliked the people who encored a favourite air in
an opera—“that just spoils it” had been his comment  but this now
appeared to him as a principle of far wider application and deeper
moment  this itch to have things over again  as if life were a film that
could be unrolled twice or even made to work backwards       was it
possibly the root of all evil  no  of course the love of money was
called that  but money itself—perhaps one valued it chiefly as a defence
against chance  a security for being able to have things over again  a
means of arresting the unrolling of the film 

he was startled from his meditation by the physical discomfort of some
weight on his knees  the dragon had lain down and deposited its long 
heavy head across them  “do you know ” he said to it in english  “that
you are a considerable nuisance ” it never moved  he decided that he had
better try and make friends with it  he stroked the hard dry head  but
the creature took no notice  then his hand passed lower down and found
softer surface  or even a chink in the mail  ah       that was where it
liked being tickled  it grunted and shot out a long cylindrical
slate-coloured tongue to lick him  it rolled round on its back revealing
an almost white belly  which ransom kneaded with his toes  his
acquaintance with the dragon prospered exceedingly  in the end it went
to sleep 

he rose and got a second shower from a bubble-tree  this made him feel
so fresh and alert that he began to think of food  he had forgotten
whereabouts on the island the yellow gourds were to be found  and as he
set out to look for them he discovered that it was difficult to walk 
for a moment he wondered whether the liquid in the bubbles had some
intoxicating quality  but a glance around assured him of the real
reason  the plain of copper-coloured heather before him  even as he
watched  swelled into a low hill and the low hill moved in his
direction  spellbound anew at the sight of land rolling towards him 
like water  in a wave  he forgot to adjust himself to the movement and
lost his feet  picking himself up  he proceeded more carefully  this
time there was no doubt about it  the sea was rising  where two
neighbouring woods made a vista to the edge of this living raft he could
see troubled water  and the warm wind was now strong enough to ruffle
his hair  he made his way gingerly towards the coast  but before he
reached it he passed some bushes which carried a rich crop of oval green
berries  about three times the size of almonds  he picked one and broke
it in two  the flesh was dryish and bread-like  something of the same
kind as a banana  it turned out to be good to eat  it did not give the
orgiastic and almost alarming pleasure of the gourds  but rather the
specific pleasure of plain food—the delight of munching and being
nourished  a “sober certainty of waking bliss ” a man  or at least a man
like ransom  felt he ought to say grace over it  and so he presently
did  the gourds would have required rather an oratorio or a mystical
meditation  but the meal had its unexpected high lights  every now and
then one struck a berry which had a bright red centre  and these were so
savoury  so memorable among a thousand tastes  that he would have begun
to look for them and to feed on them only  but that he was once more
forbidden by that same inner adviser which had already spoken to him
twice since he came to perelandra  “now on earth ” thought ransom 
“theyd soon discover how to breed these redhearts  and theyd cost a
great deal more than the others ” money  in fact  would provide the
means of saying  encore  in a voice that could not be disobeyed 

when he had finished his meal he went down to the waters edge to drink 
but before he arrived there it was already “up” to the waters edge  the
island at that moment was a little valley of bright land nestling
between hills of green water  and as he lay on his belly to drink he had
the extraordinary experience of dipping his mouth in a sea that was
higher than the shore  then he sat upright for a bit with his legs
dangling over the edge among the red weeds that fringed this little
country  his solitude became a more persistent element in his
consciousness  what had he been brought here to do  a wild fancy came
into his head that this empty world had been waiting for him as for its
first inhabitant  that he was singled out to be the founder  the
beginner  it was strange that the utter loneliness through all these
hours had not troubled him so much as one night of it on malacandra  he
thought the difference lay in this  that mere chance  or what he took
for chance  had turned him adrift in mars  but here he knew that he was
part of a plan  he was no longer unattached  no longer on the outside 

as his country climbed the smooth mountains of dimly lustrous water he
had frequent opportunity to see that many other islands were close at
hand  they varied from his own island and from one another in their
colouring more than he would have thought possible  it was a wonder to
see these big mats or carpets of land tossing all around him like yachts
in harbour on a rough day—their trees each moment at a different angle
just as the masts of the yachts would be  it was a wonder to see some
edge of vivid green or velvety crimson come creeping over the top of a
wave far above him and then wait till the whole country unrolled itself
down the waves side for him to study  sometimes his own land and a
neighbouring land would be on opposite slopes of a trough  with only a
narrow strait of water between them  and then  for the moment  you were
cheated with the semblance of a terrestrial landscape  it looked exactly
as though you were in a well-wooded valley with a river at the bottom of
it  but while you watched  that seeming river did the impossible  it
thrust itself up so that the land on either side sloped downwards from
it  and then up farther still and shouldered half the landscape out of
sight beyond its ridge  and became a huge greeny-gold hogs back of
water hanging in the sky and threatening to engulf your own land  which
now was concave and reeled backwards to the next roller  and rushing
upwards  became convex again 

a clanging  whirring noise startled him  for a moment he fancied he was
in europe and that a plane was flying low over his head  then he
recognised his friend the dragon  its tail was streaked out straight
behind it so that it looked like a flying worm  and it was heading for
an island about half a mile away  following its course with his eyes  he
saw two long lines of winged objects  dark against the gold firmament 
approaching the same island from the left and the right  but they were
not bat-winged reptiles  peering hard into the distance  he decided that
they were birds  and a musical chattering noise  presently wafted to him
by a change of the wind  confirmed this belief  they must have been a
little larger than swans  their steady approach to the same island for
which the dragon was heading fixed his attention and filled him with a
vague feeling of expectation  what followed next raised this to positive
excitement  he became aware of some creamily foamed disturbance in the
water  much nearer  and making for the same island  a whole fleet of
objects was moving in formation  he rose to his feet  then the lift of a
wave cut them off from his sight  next moment they were visible again 
hundreds of feet below him  silver-coloured objects  all alive with
circling and frisking movements       he lost them again  and swore  in
such a very uneventful world they had become important  ah         here
they were again  fish certainly  very large  obese  dolphin-like fish 
two long lines together  some of them spouting columns of
rainbow-coloured water from their noses  and one leader  there was
something queer about the leader  some sort of projection or
malformation on the back  if only the things would remain visible for
more than fifty seconds at a time  they had almost reached that other
island now  and the birds were all descending to meet them at its edge 
there was the leader again  with his hump or pillar on his back  a
moment of wild incredulity followed  and then ransom was balanced  with
legs wide apart  on the utmost fringe of his own island and shouting for
all he was worth  for at the very moment when the leading fish had
reached that neighbouring land  the land had risen up on a wave between
him and the sky  and he had seen  in perfect and unmistakable
silhouette  the thing on the fishs back reveal itself as a human form—a
human form which stepped ashore  turned with a slight inclination of its
body towards the fish and then vanished from sight as the whole island
slid over the shoulder of the billow  with beating heart ransom waited
till it was in view again  this time it was not between him and the sky 
for a second or so the human figure was undiscoverable  a stab of
something like despair pierced him  then he picked it out again—a tiny
darkish shape moving slowly between him and a patch of blue vegetation 
he waved and gesticulated and shouted till his throat was hoarse  but it
took no notice of him  every now and then he lost sight of it  even when
he found it again  he sometimes doubted whether it were not an optical
illusion—some chance figuration of foliage which his intense desire had
assimilated to the shape of a man  but always  just before he had
despaired  it would become unmistakable again  then his eyes began to
grow tired and he knew that the longer he looked the less he would see 
but he went on looking none the less 

at last  from mere exhaustion  he sat down  the solitude  which up till
now had been scarcely painful  had become a horror  any return to it was
a possibility he dared not face  the drugging and entrancing beauty had
vanished from his surroundings  take that one human form away and all
the rest of this world was now pure nightmare  a horrible cell or trap
in which he was imprisoned  the suspicion that he was beginning to
suffer from hallucinations crossed his mind  he had a picture of living
for ever and ever on this hideous island  always really alone but always
haunted by the phantoms of human beings  who would come up to him with
smiles and outstretched hands  and then fade away as he approached them 
bowing his head on his knees  he set his teeth and endeavoured to
restore some order in his mind  at first he found he was merely
listening to his own breathing and counting the beats of his heart  but
he tried again and presently succeeded  and then  like revelation  came
the very simple idea that if he wished to attract the attention of this
man-like creature he must wait till he was on the crest of a wave and
then stand up so that it would see him outlined against the sky 

three times he waited till the shore whereon he stood became a ridge 
and rose  swaying to the movement of his strange country  gesticulating 
the fourth time he succeeded  the neighbouring island was  of course 
lying for the moment beneath him like a valley  quite unmistakably the
small dark figure waved back  it detached itself from a confusing
background of greenish vegetation and began running towards him—that is 
towards the nearer coast of its own island—across an orange-coloured
field  it ran easily  the heaving surface of the field did not seem to
trouble it  then his own land reeled downwards and backwards and a great
wall of water pushed its way up between the two countries and cut each
off from sight of the other  a moment later  and ransom  from the valley
in which he now stood  saw the orange-coloured land pouring itself like
a moving hillside down the slightly convex slope of a wave far above
him  the creature was still running  the width of water between the two
islands was about thirty feet  and the creature was less than a hundred
yards away from him  he knew now that it was not merely man-like  but a
man—a green man on an orange field  green like the beautifully coloured
green beetle in an english garden  running downhill towards him with
easy strides and very swiftly  then the seas lifted his own land and the
green man became a foreshortened figure far below him  like an actor
seen from the gallery at covent garden  ransom stood on the very brink
of his island  straining his body forward and shouting  the green man
looked up  he was apparently shouting too  with his hands arched about
his mouth  but the roar of the seas smothered the noise and the next
moment ransoms island dropped into the trough of the wave and the high
green ridge of sea cut off his view  it was maddening  he was tortured
with the fear that the distance between the islands might be increasing 
thank god  here came the orange land over the crest following him down
into the pit  and there was the stranger  now on the very shore  face to
face with him  for one second the alien eyes looked at his full of love
and welcome  then the whole face changed  a shock as of disappointment
and astonishment passed over it  ransom realised  not without a
disappointment of his own  that he had been mistaken for someone else 
the running  the waving  the shouts  had not been intended for him  and
the green man was not a man at all  but a woman 

it is difficult to say why this surprised him so  granted the human
form  he was presumably as likely to meet a female as a male  but it did
surprise him  so that only when the two islands once more began to fall
apart into separate wave-valleys did he realise that he had said nothing
to her  but stood staring like a fool  and now that she was out of sight
he found his brain on fire with doubts  was  this  what he had been sent
to meet  he had been expecting wonders  had been prepared for wonders 
but not prepared for a goddess carved apparently out of green stone  yet
alive  and then it flashed across his mind—he had not noticed it while
the scene was before him—that she had been strangely accompanied  she
had stood up amidst a throng of beasts and birds as a tall sapling
stands among bushes—big pigeon-coloured birds and flame-coloured birds 
and dragons  and beaver-like creatures about the size of rats  and
heraldic-looking fish in the sea at her feet  or had he imagined that 
was this the beginning of the hallucinations he had feared  or another
myth coming out into the world of fact—perhaps a more terrible myth  of
circe or alcina  and the expression on her face       what had she
expected to find that made the finding of him such a disappointment 

the other island became visible again  he had been right about the
animals  they surrounded her ten or twenty deep  all facing her  most of
them motionless  but some of them finding their places  as at a
ceremony  with delicate noiseless movements  the birds were in long
lines and more of them seemed to be alighting on the island every moment
and joining these lines  from a wood of bubble-trees behind her half a
dozen creatures like very short-legged and elongated pigs—the dachshunds
of the pig world—were waddling up to join the assembly  tiny frog-like
beasts  like those he had seen falling in the rain  kept leaping about
her  sometimes higher than her head  sometimes alighting on her
shoulders  their colours were so vivid that at first he mistook them for
kingfishers  amidst all this she stood looking at him  her feet
together  her arms hanging at her sides  her stare level and unafraid 
communicating nothing  ransom determined to speak  using the old solar
tongue  “i am from another world ” he began and then stopped  the green
lady had done something for which he was quite unprepared  she raised
her arm and pointed at him  not as in menace  but as though inviting the
other creatures to behold him  at the same moment her face changed
again  and for a second he thought she was going to cry  instead she
burst into laughter—peal upon peal of laughter till her whole body shook
with it  till she bent almost double  with her hands resting on her
knees  still laughing and repeatedly pointing at him  the animals  like
our own dogs in similar circumstances  dimly understood that there was
merriment afoot  all manner of gambolling  wing-clapping  snorting  and
standing upon hind legs began to be displayed  and still the green lady
laughed till yet again the wave divided them and she was out of sight 

ransom was thunderstruck  had the eldila sent him to meet an idiot  or
an evil spirit that mocked men  or was it after all a hallucination —for
this was just how a hallucination might be expected to behave  then an
idea occurred to him which would have taken much longer  perhaps  to
occur to me or you  it might not be she who was mad but he who was
ridiculous  he glanced down at himself  certainly his legs presented an
odd spectacle  for one was brownish-red  like the flanks of a titian
satyr  and the other was white—by comparison  almost a leprous white  as
far as self-inspection could go  he had the same parti-coloured
appearance all over—no unnatural result of his one-sided exposure to the
sun during the voyage  had this been the joke  he felt a momentary
impatience with the creature who could mar the meeting of two worlds
with laughter at such a triviality  then he smiled in spite of himself
at the very undistinguished career he was having on perelandra  for
dangers he had been prepared  but to be first a disappointment and then
an absurdity       hullo  here were the lady and her island in sight
again 

she had recovered from her laughter and sat with her legs trailing in
the sea  half unconsciously caressing a gazelle-like creature which had
thrust its soft nose under her arm  it was difficult to believe that she
had ever laughed  ever done anything but sit on the shore of her
floating isle  never had ransom seen a face so calm  and so unearthly 
despite the full humanity of every feature  he decided afterwards that
the unearthly quality was due to the complete absence of that element of
resignation which mixes  in however slight a degree  with all profound
stillness in terrestrial faces  this was a calm which no storm had ever
preceded  it might be idiocy  it might be immortality  it might be some
condition of mind to which terrestrial experience offered no clue at
all  a curious and rather horrifying sensation crept over him  on the
ancient planet malacandra he had met creatures who were not even
remotely human in form but who had turned out  on further acquaintance 
to be rational and friendly  under an alien exterior he had discovered a
heart like his own  was he now to have the reverse experience  for now
he realised that the word “human” refers to something more than the
bodily form or even to the rational mind  it refers also to that
community of blood and experience which unites all men and women on the
earth  but this creature was not of his race  no windings  however
intricate  of any genealogical tree  could ever establish a connection
between himself and her  in that sense  not one drop in her veins was
“human ” the universe had produced her species and his quite
independently 

all this passed through his mind very quickly  and was speedily
interrupted by his consciousness that the light was changing  at first
he thought that the green creature had  of herself  began to turn bluish
and to shine with a strange electric radiance  then he noticed that the
whole landscape was a blaze of blue and purple—and almost at the same
time that the two islands were not so close together as they had been 
he glanced at the sky  the many-coloured furnace of the short-lived
evening was kindled all about him  in a few minutes it would be pitch
black       and the islands were drifting apart  speaking slowly in that
ancient language  he cried out to her  “i am a stranger  i come in
peace  is it your will that i swim over to your land ”

the green lady looked quickly at him with an expression of curiosity 

“what is peace ” she asked 

ransom could have danced with impatience  already it was visibly darker
and there was no doubt now that the distance between the islands was
increasing  just as he was about to speak again a wave rose between them
and once more she was out of sight  and as that wave hung above him 
shining purple in the light of the sunset  he noticed how dark the sky
beyond it had become  it was already through a kind of twilight that he
looked down from the next ridge upon the other island far below him  he
flung himself into the water  for some seconds he found a difficulty in
getting clear of the shore  then he seemed to succeed and struck out 
almost at once he found himself back again among the red weeds and
bladders  a moment or two of violent struggling followed and then he was
free—and swimming steadily—and then  almost without warning  swimming in
total darkness  he swam on  but despair of finding the other land  or
even of saving his life  now gripped him  the perpetual change of the
great swell abolished all sense of direction  it could only be by chance
that he would land anywhere  indeed  he judged from the time he had
already been in the water that he must have been swimming  along  the
space between the islands instead of across it  he tried to alter his
course  then doubted the wisdom of this  tried to return to his original
course  and became so confused that he could not be sure he had done
either  he kept on telling himself that he must keep his head  he was
beginning to be tired  he gave up all attempts to guide himself 
suddenly  a long time after  he felt vegetation sliding past him  he
gripped and pulled  delicious smells of fruit and flowers came to him
out of the darkness  he pulled harder still on his aching arms  finally
he found himself  safe and panting  on the dry  sweet-scented 
undulating surface of an island 




                                  five


ransom must have fallen asleep almost as soon as he landed  for he
remembered nothing more till what seemed the song of a bird broke in
upon his dreams  opening his eyes  he saw that it was a bird indeed  a
long-legged bird like a very small stork  singing rather like a canary 
full daylight—or what passes for such in perelandra—was all about him 
and in his heart such a premonition of good adventure as made him sit up
forthwith and brought him  a moment later  to his feet  he stretched his
arms and looked around  he was not on the orange-coloured island  but on
the same island which had been his home ever since he came to this
planet  he was floating in a dead calm and therefore had no difficulty
in making his way to the shore  and there he stopped in astonishment 
the ladys island was floating beside his  divided only by five feet or
so of water  the whole look of the world had changed  there was no
expanse of sea now visible—only a flat wooded landscape as far as the
eye could reach in every direction  some ten or twelve of the islands 
in fact  were here lying together and making a short-lived continent 
and there walking before him  as if on the other side of a brook  was
the lady herself—walking with her head a little bowed and her hands
occupied in plaiting together some blue flowers  she was singing to
herself in a low voice but stopped and turned as he hailed her and
looked him full in the face 

“i was young yesterday ” she began  but he did not hear the rest of her
speech  the meeting  now that it had actually come about  proved
overwhelming  you must not misunderstand the story at this point  what
overwhelmed him was not in the least the fact that she  like himself 
was totally naked  embarrassment and desire were both a thousand miles
away from his experience  and if he was a little ashamed of his own
body  that was a shame which had nothing to do with difference of sex
and turned only on the fact that he knew his body to be a little ugly
and a little ridiculous  still less was her colour a source of horror to
him  in her own world that green was beautiful and fitting  it was his
pasty white and angry sunburn which were the monstrosity  it was neither
of these  but he found himself unnerved  he had to ask her presently to
repeat what she had been saying 

“i was young yesterday ” she said  “when i laughed at you  now i know
that the people in your world do not like to be laughed at ”

“you say you were young ”

“yes ”

“are you not young to-day also ”

she appeared to be thinking for a few moments  so intently that the
flowers dropped  unregarded  from her hand 

“i see it now ” she said presently  “it is very strange to say one is
young at the moment one is speaking  but to-morrow i shall be older  and
then i shall say i was young to-day  you are quite right  this is great
wisdom you are bringing  o piebald man ”

“what do you mean ”

“this looking backward and forward along the line and seeing how a day
has one appearance as it comes to you  and another when you are in it 
and a third when it has gone past  like the waves ”

“but you are very little older than yesterday ”

“how do you know that ”

“i mean ” said ransom  “a night is not a very long time ”

she thought again  and then spoke suddenly  her face lightening  “i see
it now ” she said  “you think times have lengths  a night is always a
night whatever you do in it  as from this tree to that is always so many
paces whether you take them quickly or slowly  i suppose that is true in
a way  but the waves do not always come at equal distances  i see that
you come from a wise world       if this is wise  i have never done it
before—stepping out of life into the alongside and looking at oneself
living as if one were not alive  do they all do that in your world 
piebald ”

“what do you know about other worlds ” said ransom 

“i know this  beyond the roof it is all deep heaven  the high place  and
the low is not really spread out as it seems to be”  here she indicated
the whole landscape  “but is rolled up into little balls  little lumps
of the low swimming in the high  and the oldest and greatest of them
have on them that which we have never seen nor heard and cannot at all
understand  but on the younger maleldil has made to grow the things like
us  that breathe and breed ”

“how have you found all this out  your roof is so dense that your people
cannot see through into deep heaven and look at the other worlds ”

up till now her face had been grave  at this point she clapped her hands
and a smile such as ransom had never seen changed her  one does not see
that smile here except in children  but there was nothing of the child
about it there 

“oh  i see it ” she said  “i am older now  your world has no roof  you
look right out into the high place and see the great dance with your own
eyes  you live always in that terror and that delight  and what we must
only believe you can behold  is not this a wonderful invention of
maleldils  when i was young i could imagine no beauty but this of our
own world  but he can think of all  and all different ”

“that is one of the things that is bewildering me ” said ransom  “that
you are not different  you are shaped like the women of my own kind  i
had not expected that  i have been in one other world beside my own  but
the creatures there are not at all like you and me ”

“what is bewildering about it ”

“i do not see why different worlds should bring forth like creatures  do
different trees bring forth like fruit ”

“but that other world was older than yours ” she said 

“how do you know that ” asked ransom in amazement 

“maleldil is telling me ” answered the woman  and as she spoke the
landscape had become different  though with a difference none of the
senses would identify  the light was dim  the air gentle  and all
ransoms body was bathed in bliss  but the garden world where he stood
seemed to be packed quite full  and as if an unendurable pressure had
been laid upon his shoulders  his legs failed him and he half sank  half
fell  into a sitting position 

“it all comes into my mind now ” she continued  “i see the big furry
creatures  and the white giants—what is it you called them —the sorns 
and the blue rivers  oh  what a strong pleasure it would be to see them
with my outward eyes  to touch them  and the stronger because there are
no more of that kind to come  it is only in the ancient worlds they
linger yet ”

“why ” said ransom in a whisper  looking up at her 

“you must know that better than i ” she said  “for was it not in your
own world that all this happened ”

“all what ”

“i thought it would be you who would tell me of it ” said the woman  now
in her turn bewildered 

“what are you talking about ” said ransom 

“i mean ” said she  “that in your world maleldil first took himself this
form  the form of your race and mine ”

“you know that ” said ransom sharply  those who have had a dream which
is very beautiful but from which  nevertheless  they have ardently
desired to awake  will understand his sensations 

“yes  i know that  maleldil has made me older to that amount since we
began speaking ” the expression on her face was such as he had never
seen  and could not steadily look at  the whole of this adventure seemed
to be slipping out of his hands  there was a long silence  he stooped
down to the water and drank before he spoke again 

“oh  my lady ” he said  “why do you say that such creatures linger only
in the ancient worlds ”

“are you so young ” she answered  “how could they come again  since our
beloved became a man  how should reason in any world take on another
form  do you not understand  that is all over  among times there is a
time that turns a corner and everything this side of it is new  times do
not go backward ”

“and can one little world like mine be the corner ”

“i do not understand  corner with us is not the name of a size ”

“and do you ” said ransom with some hesitation—“and do you know  why  he
came thus to my world ”

all through this part of the conversation he found it difficult to look
higher than her feet  so that her answer was merely a voice in the air
above him  “yes ” said the voice  “i know the reason  but it is not the
reason you know  there was more than one reason  and there is one i know
and cannot tell to you  and another that you know and cannot tell to
me ”

“and after this ” said ransom  “it will all be men ”

“you say it as if you were sorry ”

“i think ” said ransom  “i have no more understanding than a beast  i do
not well know what i am saying  but i loved the furry people whom i met
in malacandra  that old world  are they to be swept away  are they only
rubbish in the deep heaven ”

“i do not know what  rubbish  means ” she answered  “nor what you are
saying  you do not mean they are worse because they come early in the
history and do not come again  they are their own part of the history
and not another  we are on this side of the wave and they on the far
side  all is new ”

one of ransoms difficulties was an inability to be quite sure who was
speaking at any moment in this conversation  it may  or may not  have
been due to the fact that he could not look long at her face  and now he
wanted the conversation to end  he had “had enough”—not in the
half-comic sense whereby we use those words to mean that a man has had
too much  but in the plain sense  he had had his fill  like a man who
has slept or eaten enough  even an hour ago  he would have found it
difficult to express this quite bluntly  but now it came naturally to
him to say 

“i do not wish to talk any more  but i would like to come over to your
island so that we may meet again when we wish ”

“which do you call my island ” said the lady 

“the one you are on ” said ransom  “what else ”

“come ” she said  with a gesture that made that whole world a house and
her a hostess  he slid into the water and scrambled out beside her  then
he bowed  a little clumsily as all modern men do  and walked away from
her into a neighbouring wood  he found his legs unsteady and they ached
a little  in fact a curious physical exhaustion possessed him  he sat
down to rest for a few minutes and fell immediately into dreamless
sleep 

he awoke completely refreshed but with a sense of insecurity  this had
nothing to do with the fact that he found himself  on waking  strangely
attended  at his feet  and with its snout partially resting upon them 
lay the dragon  it had one eye shut and one open  as he rose on his
elbow and looked about him he found that he had another custodian at his
head  a furred animal something like a wallaby but yellow  it was the
yellowest thing he had ever seen  as soon as he moved both beasts began
nudging him  they would not leave him alone till he rose  and when he
had risen they would not let him walk in any direction but one  the
dragon was much too heavy for him to shove it out of the way  and the
yellow beast danced round him in a fashion that headed him off from
every direction but the one it wanted him to go  he yielded to their
pressure and allowed himself to be shepherded  first through a wood of
higher and browner trees than he had yet seen and then across a small
open space and into a kind of alley of bubble trees and beyond that into
large fields of silver flowers that grew waist-high  and then he saw
that they had been bringing him to be shown to their mistress  she was
standing a few yards away  motionless but not apparently
disengaged—doing something with her mind  perhaps even with her muscles 
that he did not understand  it was the first time he had looked steadily
at her  himself unobserved  and she seemed more strange to him than
before  there was no category in the terrestrial mind which would fit
her  opposites met in her and were fused in a fashion for which we have
no images  one way of putting it would be to say that neither our sacred
nor our profane art could make her portrait  beautiful  naked 
shameless  young—she was obviously a goddess  but then the face  the
face so calm that it escaped insipidity by the very concentration of its
mildness  the face that was like the sudden coldness and stillness of a
church when we enter it from a hot street—that made her a madonna  the
alert  inner silence which looked out from those eyes overawed him  yet
at any moment she might laugh like a child  or run like artemis or dance
like a mænad  all this against the golden sky which looked as if it were
only an arms length above her head  the beasts raced forward to greet
her  and as they rushed through the feathery vegetation they startled
from it masses of the frogs  so that it looked as if huge drops of
vividly coloured dew were being tossed in the air  she turned as they
approached her and welcomed them  and once again the picture was half
like many earthly scenes but in its total effect unlike them all  it was
not really like a woman making much of a horse  nor yet a child playing
with a puppy  there was in her face an authority  in her caresses a
condescension  which by taking seriously the inferiority of her adorers
made them somehow less inferior—raised them from the status of pets to
that of slaves  as ransom reached her she stooped and whispered
something in the ear of the yellow creature  and then  addressing the
dragon  bleated to it almost in its own voice  both of them  having
received their congé  darted back into the woods 

“the beasts in your world seem almost rational ” said ransom 

“we make them older every day ” she answered  “is not that what it means
to be a beast ”

but ransom clung to her use of the word  we  

“that is what i have come to speak to you about ” he said  “maleldil has
sent me to your world for some purpose  do you know what it is ”

she stood for a moment almost like one listening and then answered “no ”

“then you must take me to your home and show me to your people ”

“people  i do not know what you are saying ”

“your kindred—the others of your kind ”

“do you mean the king ”

“yes  if you have a king  i had better be brought before him ”

“i cannot do that ” she answered  “i do not know where to find him ”

“to your own home then ”

“what is  home  ”

“the place where people live together and have their possessions and
bring up their children ”

she spread out her hands to indicate all that was in sight  “this is my
home ” she said 

“do you live here alone ” asked ransom 

“what is  alone  ”

ransom tried a fresh start  “bring me where i shall meet others of our
kind ”

“if you mean the king  i have already told you i do not know where he
is  when we were young—many days ago—we were leaping from island to
island  and when he was on one and i was on another the waves rose and
we were driven apart ”

“but can you take me to some other of your kind  the king cannot be the
only one ”

“he is the only one  did you not know ”

“but there must be others of your kind—your brothers and sisters  your
kindred  your friends ”

“i do not know what these words mean ”

“who is this king ” said ransom in desperation 

“he is himself  he is the king ” said she  “how can one answer such a
question ”

“look here ” said ransom  “you must have had a mother  is she alive 
where is she  when did you see her last ”

“i have a mother ” said the green lady  looking full at him with eyes of
untroubled wonder  “what do you mean  i  am  the mother ” and once again
there fell upon ransom the feeling that it was not she  or not she only 
who had spoken  no other sound came to his ears  for the sea and the air
were still  but a phantom sense of vast choral music was all about him 
the awe which her apparently witless replies had been dissipating for
the last few minutes returned upon him 

“i do not understand ” he said 

“nor i ” answered the lady  “only my spirit praises maleldil who comes
down from deep heaven into this lowness and will make me to be blessed
by all the times that are rolling towards us  it is he who is strong and
makes me strong and fills empty worlds with good creatures ”

“if you are a mother  where are your children ”

“not yet ” she answered 

“who will be their father ”

“the king—who else ”

“but the king—had he no father ”

“he  is  the father ”

“you mean ” said ransom slowly  “that you and he are the only two of
your kind in the whole world ”

“of course ” then presently her face changed  “oh  how young i have
been ” she said  “i see it now  i had known that there were many
creatures in that ancient world of the hrossa and the sorns  but i had
forgotten that yours also was an older world than ours  i see—there are
many of you by now  i had been thinking that of you also there were only
two  i thought you were the king and father of your world  but there are
children of children of children by now  and you perhaps are one of
these ”

“yes ” said ransom 

“greet your lady and mother well from me when you return to your own
world ” said the green woman  and now for the first time there was a
note of deliberate courtesy  even of ceremony  in her speech  ransom
understood  she knew now at last that she was not addressing an equal 
she was a queen sending a message to a queen through a commoner  and her
manner to him was henceforward more gracious  he found it difficult to
make his next answer 

“our mother and lady is dead ” he said 

“what is  dead  ”

“with us they go away after a time  maleldil takes the soul out of them
and puts it somewhere else—in deep heaven  we hope  they call it death ”

“do not wonder  o piebald man  that your world should have been chosen
for times corner  you live looking out always on heaven itself  and as
if this were not enough maleldil takes you all thither in the end  you
are favoured beyond all worlds ”

ransom shook his head  “no  it is not like that ” he said 

“i wonder ” said the woman  “if you were sent here to teach us  death  ”

“you dont understand ” he said  “it is not like that  it is horrible 
it has a foul smell  maleldil himself wept when he saw it ” both his
voice and his facial expression were apparently something new to her  he
saw the shock  not of horror  but of utter bewilderment  on her face for
one instant and then  without effort  the ocean of her peace swallowed
it up as if it had never been  and she asked him what he meant 

“you could never understand  lady ” he replied  “but in our world not
all events are pleasing or welcome  there may be such a thing that you
would cut off both your arms and your legs to prevent it happening—and
yet it happens  with us ”

“but how can one wish any of those waves not to reach us which maleldil
is rolling towards us ”

against his better judgment ransom found himself goaded into argument 

“but even you ” he said  “when you first saw me  i know now you were
expecting and hoping that i was the king  when you found i was not  your
face changed  was  that  event not unwelcome  did you not wish it to be
otherwise ”

“oh ” said the lady  she turned aside with her head bowed and her hands
clasped in an intensity of thought  she looked up and said  “you make me
grow older more quickly than i can bear ” and walked a little farther
off  ransom wondered what he had done  it was suddenly borne in upon him
that her purity and peace were not  as they had seemed  things settled
and inevitable like the purity and peace of an animal—that they were
alive and therefore breakable  a balance maintained by a mind and
therefore  at least in theory  able to be lost  there is no reason why a
man on a smooth road should lose his balance on a bicycle  but he could 
there was no reason why she should step out of her happiness into the
psychology of our own race  but neither was there any wall between to
prevent her doing so  the sense of precariousness terrified him  but
when she looked at him again he changed that word to adventure  and then
all words died out of his mind  once more he could not look steadily at
her  he knew now what the old painters were trying to represent when
they invented the halo  gaiety and gravity together  a splendour as of
martyrdom yet with no pain in it at all  seemed to pour from her
countenance  yet when she spoke her words were a disappointment 

“i have been so young till this moment that all my life now seems to
have been a kind of sleep  i have thought that i was being carried  and
behold  i was walking ”

ransom asked what she meant 

“what you have made me see ” answered the lady  “is as plain as the sky 
but i never saw it before  yet it has happened every day  one goes into
the forest to pick food and already the thought of one fruit rather than
another has grown up in ones mind  then  it may be  one finds a
different fruit and not the fruit one thought of  one joy was expected
and another is given  but this i had never noticed before—that the very
moment of the finding there is in the mind a kind of thrusting back  or
setting aside  the picture of the fruit you have  not  found is still 
for a moment  before you  and if you wished—if it were possible to
wish—you could keep it there  you could send your soul after the good
you had expected  instead of turning it to the good you had got  you
could refuse the real good  you could make the real fruit taste insipid
by thinking of the other ”

ransom interrupted  “that is hardly the same thing as finding a stranger
when you wanted your husband ”

“oh  that is how i came to understand the whole thing  you and the king
differ more than two kinds of fruit  the joy of finding him again and
the joy of all the new knowledge i have had from you are more unlike
than two tastes  and when the difference is as great as that  and each
of the two things so great  then the first picture does stay in the mind
quite a long time—many beats of the heart—after the other good has come 
and this  o piebald  is the glory and wonder you have made me see  that
it is i  i myself  who turn from the good expected to the given good 
out of my own heart i do it  one can conceive a heart which did not 
which clung to the good it had first thought of and turned the good
which was given it into no good ”

“i dont see the wonder and the glory of it ” said ransom 

her eyes flashed upon him such a triumphant flight above his thoughts as
would have been scorn in earthly eyes  but in that world it was not
scorn 

“i thought ” she said  “that i was carried in the will of him i love 
but now i see that i walk with it  i thought that the good things he
sent me drew me into them as the waves lift the islands  but now i see
that it is i who plunge into them with my own legs and arms  as when we
go swimming  i feel as if i were living in that roofless world of yours
where men walk undefended beneath naked heaven  it is a delight with
terror in it  ones own self to be walking from one good to another 
walking beside him as himself may walk  not even holding hands  how has
he made me so separate from himself  how did it enter his mind to
conceive such a thing  the world is so much larger than i thought  i
thought we went along paths—but it seems there are no paths  the going
itself is the path ”

“and have you no fear ” said ransom  “that it will ever be hard to turn
your heart from the thing you wanted to the thing maleldil sends ”

“i see ” said the lady presently  “the wave you plunge into may be very
swift and great  you may need all your force to swim into it  you mean 
he might send me a good like that ”

“yes—or like a wave so swift and great that all your force was too
little ”

“it often happens that way in swimming ” said the lady  “is not that
part of the delight ”

“but are you happy without the king  do you not  want  the king ”

“want him ” she said  “how could there be anything i did not want ”

there was something in her replies that began to repel ransom  “you
cant want him very much if you are happy without him ” he said  and was
immediately surprised at the sulkiness of his own voice 

“why ” said the lady  “and why  o piebald  are you making little hills
and valleys in your forehead and why do you give a little lift of your
shoulders  are these the signs of something in your world ”

“they mean nothing ” said ransom hastily  it was a small lie  but there
it would not do  it tore him as he uttered it  like a vomit  it became
of infinite importance  the silver meadow and the golden sky seemed to
fling it back at him  as if stunned by some measureless anger in the
very air he stammered an emendation  “they mean nothing i could explain
to you ” the lady was looking at him with a new and more judicial
expression  perhaps in the presence of the first mothers son she had
ever seen  she was already dimly forecasting the problems that might
arise when she had children of her own 

“we have talked enough now ” she said at last  at first he thought she
was going to turn away and leave him  then  when she did not move  he
bowed and drew back a step or two  she still said nothing and seemed to
have forgotten about him  he turned and retraced his way through the
deep vegetation until they were out of sight of each other  the audience
was at an end 




                                  six


as soon as the lady was out of sight ransoms first impulse was to run
his hands through his hair  to expel the breath from his lungs in a long
whistle  to light a cigarette  to put his hands in his pockets  and in
general  to go through all that ritual of relaxation which a man
performs on finding himself alone after a rather trying interview  but
he had no cigarettes and no pockets  nor indeed did he feel himself
alone  that sense of being in someones presence which had descended on
him with such unbearable pressure during the very first moments of his
conversation with the lady did not disappear when he had left her  it
was  if anything  increased  her society had been  in some degree  a
protection against it  and her absence left him not to solitude but to a
more formidable kind of privacy  at first it was almost intolerable  as
he put it to us  in telling the story  “there seemed no  room  ” but
later on  he discovered that it was intolerable only at certain
moments—at just those moments in fact  symbolised by his impulse to
smoke and to put his hands in his pockets  when a man asserts his
independence and feels that now at last hes on his own  when you felt
like that  then the very air seemed too crowded to breathe  a complete
fulness seemed to be excluding you from a place which  nevertheless  you
were unable to leave  but when you gave in to the thing  gave yourself
up to it  there was no burden to be borne  it became not a load but a
medium  a sort of splendour as of eatable  drinkable  breathable gold 
which fed and carried you and not only poured into you but out from you
as well  taken the wrong way  it suffocated  taken the right way  it
made terrestrial life seem  by comparison  a vacuum  at first  of
course  the wrong moments occurred pretty often  but like a man who has
a wound that hurts him in certain positions and who gradually learns to
avoid those positions  ransom learned not to make that inner gesture 
his day became better and better as the hours passed 

during the course of the day he explored the island pretty thoroughly 
the sea was still calm and it would have been possible in many
directions to have reached neighbouring islands by a mere jump  he was
placed  however  at the edge of this temporary archipelago  and from one
shore he found himself looking out on the open sea  they were lying  or
else very slowly drifting  in the neighbourhood of the huge green column
which he had seen a few moments after his arrival in perelandra  he had
an excellent view of this object at about a miles distance  it was
clearly a mountainous island  the column turned out to be really a
cluster of columns—that is  of crags much higher than they were broad 
rather like exaggerated dolomites  but smoother  so much smoother in
fact that it might be truer to describe them as pillars from the giants
causeway magnified to the height of mountains  this huge upright mass
did not  however  rise directly from the sea  the island had a base of
rough country  but with smoother land at the coast  and a hint of
valleys with vegetation in them between the ridges  and even of steeper
and narrower valleys which ran some way up between the central crags  it
was certainly land  real fixed land with its roots in the solid surface
of the planet  he could dimly make out the texture of true rock from
where he sat  some of it was inhabitable land  he felt a great desire to
explore it  it looked as if a landing would present no difficulties  and
even the great mountain itself might turn out to be climbable 

he did not see the lady again that day  early next morning  after he had
amused himself by swimming for a little and eaten his first meal  he was
again seated on the shore looking out towards the fixed land  suddenly
he heard her voice behind him and looked round  she had come forth from
the woods with some beasts  as usual  following her  her words had been
words of greeting  but she showed no disposition to talk  she came and
stood on the edge of the floating island beside him and looked with him
towards the fixed land 

“i will go there ” she said at last 

“may i go with you ” asked ransom 

“if you will ” said the lady  “but you see it is the fixed land ”

“that is why i wish to tread on it ” said ransom  “in my world all the
lands are fixed  and it would give me pleasure to walk in such a land
again ”

she gave a sudden exclamation of surprise and stared at him 

“where  then  do you live in your world ” she asked 

“on the lands ”

“but you said they are all fixed ”

“yes  we live on the fixed lands ”

for the first time since they had met  something not quite unlike an
expression of horror or disgust passed over her face 

“but what do you do during the nights ”

“during the nights ” said ransom in bewilderment  “why  we sleep  of
course ”

“but where ”

“where we live  on the land ”

she remained in deep thought so long that ransom feared she was never
going to speak again  when she did  her voice was hushed and once more
tranquil  though the note of joy had not yet returned to it 

“he has never bidden you not to ” she said  less as a question than as a
statement 

“no ” said ransom 

“there can  then  be different laws in different worlds ”

“is there a law in your world not to sleep in a fixed land ”

“yes ” said the lady  “he does not wish us to dwell there  we may land
on them and walk on them  for the world is ours  but to stay there—to
sleep and awake there      ” she ended with a shudder 

“you couldnt have that law in our world ” said ransom  “there  are  no
floating lands with us ”

“how many of you are there ” asked the lady suddenly 

ransom found that he didnt know the population of the earth  but
contrived to give her some idea of many millions  he had expected her to
be astonished  but it appeared that numbers did not interest her  “how
do you all find room on your fixed land ” she asked 

“there is not one fixed land  but many ” he answered  “and they are big 
almost as big as the sea ”

“how do you endure it ” she burst out  “almost half your world empty and
dead  loads and loads of land  all tied down  does not the very thought
of it crush you ”

“not at all ” said ransom  “the very thought of a world which was all
sea like yours would make my people unhappy and afraid ”

“where will this end ” said the lady  speaking more to herself than to
him  “i have grown so old in these last few hours that all my life
before seems only like the stem of a tree  and now i am like the
branches shooting out in every direction  they are getting so wide apart
that i can hardly bear it  first to have learned that i walk from good
to good with my own feet       that was a stretch enough  but now it
seems that good is not the same in all worlds  that maleldil has
forbidden in one what he allows in another ”

“perhaps my world is wrong about this ” said ransom rather feebly  for
he was dismayed at what he had done 

“it is not so ” said she  “maleldil himself has told me now  and it
could not be so  if your world has no floating lands  but he is not
telling me why he has forbidden it to us ”

“theres probably some good reason ” began ransom  when he was
interrupted by her sudden laughter 

“oh  piebald  piebald ” she said  still laughing  “how often the people
of your race speak ”

“im sorry ” said ransom  a little put out 

“what are you sorry for ”

“i am sorry if you think i talk too much ”

“too much  how can i tell what would be too much for you to talk ”

“in our world when they say a man talks much they mean they wish him to
be silent ”

“if that is what they mean  why do they not say it ”

“what made you laugh ” asked ransom  finding her question too hard 

“i laughed  piebald  because you were wondering  as i was  about this
law which maleldil has made for one world and not for another  and you
had nothing to say about it and yet made the nothing up into words ”

“i  had  something to say  though ” said ransom almost under his breath 
“at least ” he added in a louder voice  “this forbidding is no hardship
in such a world as yours ”

“that also is a strange thing to say ” replied the lady  “who thought of
its being hard  the beasts would not think it hard if i told them to
walk on their heads  it would become their delight to walk on their
heads  i am his beast  and all his biddings are joys  it is not that
which makes me thoughtful  but it was coming into my mind to wonder
whether there are two kinds of bidding ”

“some of our wise men have said      ” began ransom  when she
interrupted him 

“let us wait and ask the king ” she said  “for i think  piebald  you do
not know much more about this than i do ”

“yes  the king  by all means ” said ransom  “if only we can find him ”
then  quite involuntarily  he added in english  “by jove  what was
that ” she also had exclaimed  something like a shooting star seemed to
have streaked across the sky  far away on their left  and some seconds
later an indeterminate noise reached their ears 

“what was that ” he asked again  this time in old solar 

“something has fallen out of deep heaven ” said the lady  her face
showed wonder and curiosity  but on earth we so rarely see these
emotions without some admixture of defensive fear that her expression
seemed strange to him 

“i think youre right ” said he  “hullo  whats this ” the calm sea had
swelled and all the weeds at the edge of their island were in movement 
a single wave passed under their island and all was still again 

“something has certainly fallen into the sea ” said the lady  then she
resumed the conversation as if nothing had happened 

“it was to look for the king that i had resolved to go over to-day to
the fixed land  he is on none of these islands here  for i have searched
them all  but if we climbed high up on the fixed land and looked about 
then we should see a long way  we could see if there are any other
islands near us ”

“let us do this ” said ransom  “if we can swim so far ”

“we shall ride ” said the lady  then she knelt down on the shore—and
such grace was in all her movements that it was a wonder to see her
kneel—and gave three low calls all on the same note  at first no result
was visible  but soon ransom saw broken water coming rapidly towards
them  a moment later and the sea beside the island was a mass of the
large silver fishes  spouting  curling their bodies  pressing upon one
another to get nearer  and the nearest ones nosing the land  they had
not only the colour but the smoothness of silver  the biggest were about
nine feet long and all were thick-set and powerful-looking  they were
very unlike any terrestrial species  for the base of the head was
noticeably wider than the foremost part of the trunk  but then the trunk
itself grew thicker again towards the tail  without this tailward bulge
they would have looked like giant tadpoles  as it was  they suggested
rather pot-bellied and narrow-chested old men with very big heads  the
lady seemed to take a long time in selecting two of them  but the moment
she had done so the others all fell back for a few yards and the two
successful candidates wheeled round and lay still with their tails to
the shore  gently moving their fins  “now  piebald  like this ” she
said  and seated herself astride the narrow part of the right-hand fish 
ransom followed her example  the great head in front of him served
instead of shoulders so that there was no danger of sliding off  he
watched his hostess  she gave her fish a slight kick with her heels  he
did the same to his  a moment later they were gliding out to sea at
about six miles an hour  the air over the water was cooler and the
breeze lifted his hair  in a world where he had as yet only swum and
walked  the fishs progress gave the impression of quite an exhilarating
speed  he glanced back and saw the feathery and billowy mass of the
islands receding and the sky growing larger and more emphatically
golden  ahead  the fantastically shaped and coloured mountain dominated
his whole field of vision  he noticed with interest that the whole
school of rejected fish were still with them—some following  but the
majority gambolling in wide extended wings to left and right 

“do they always follow like this ” he asked 

“do the beasts not follow in your world ” she replied  “we cannot ride
more than two  it would be hard if those we did not choose were not even
allowed to follow ”

“was that why you took so long to choose the two fish  lady ” he asked 

“of course ” said the lady  “i try not to choose the same fish too
often ”

the land came towards them apace and what had seemed level coastline
began to open into bays and thrust itself forward into promontories  and
now they were near enough to see that in this apparently calm ocean
there was an invisible swell  a very faint rise and fall of water on the
beach  a moment later the fishes lacked depth to swim any further  and
following the green ladys example  ransom slipped both his legs to one
side of his fish and groped down with his toes  oh  ecstasy —they
touched solid pebbles  he had not realised till now that he was pining
for “fixed land ” he looked up  down to the bay in which they were
landing ran a steep narrow valley with low cliffs and outcroppings of a
reddish rock and  lower down  banks of some kind of moss and a few
trees  the trees might almost have been terrestrial  planted in any
southern country of our own world they would not have seemed remarkable
to anyone except a trained botanist  best of all  down the middle of the
valley—and welcome to ransoms eyes and ears as a glimpse of home or of
heaven—ran a little stream  a dark translucent stream where a man might
hope for trout 

“you love this land  piebald ” said the lady  glancing at him 

“yes ” said he  “it is like my own world ”

they began to walk up the valley to its head  when they were under the
trees the resemblance of an earthly country was diminished  for there is
so much less light in that world that the glade which should have cast
only a little shadow cast a forest gloom  it was about a quarter of a
mile to the top of the valley  where it narrowed into a mere cleft
between low rocks  with one or two grips and a leap the lady was up
these  and ransom followed  he was amazed at her strength  they emerged
into a steep upland covered with a kind of turf which would have been
very like grass but that there was more blue in it  it seemed to be
closely cropped and dotted with white fluffy objects as far as the eye
could reach 

“flowers ” asked ransom  the lady laughed 

“no  these are the piebalds  i named you after them ” he was puzzled for
a moment but presently the objects began to move  and soon to move
quickly  towards the human pair whom they had apparently winded—for they
were already so high that there was a strong breeze  in a moment they
were bounding all about the lady and welcoming her  they were white
beasts with black spots—about the size of sheep but with ears so much
larger  noses so much mobile  and tails so much longer  that the general
impression was rather of enormous mice  their claw-like or almost
hand-like paws were clearly built for climbing  and the bluish turf was
their food  after a proper interchange of courtesies with these
creatures  ransom and the lady continued their journey  the circle of
golden sea below them was now spread out in an enormous expanse and the
green rock pillars above seemed almost to overhang  but it was a long
and stiff climb to their base  the temperature here was much lower 
though it was still warm  the silence was also noticeable  down below 
on the islands  though one had not remarked it at the time  there must
have been a continual background of water noises  bubble noises  and the
movement of beasts 

they were now entering into a kind of bay or re-entrant of turf between
two of the green pillars  seen from below these had appeared to touch
one another  but now  though they had gone in so deep between two of
them that most of the view was cut off on either hand  there was still
room for a battalion to march in line  the slope grew steeper every
moment  and as it grew steeper the space between the pillars also grew
narrower  soon they were scrambling on hands and knees in a place where
the green walls hemmed them in so that they must go in single file  and
ransom  looking up  could hardly see the sky overhead  finally they were
faced with a little bit of real rock work—a neck of stone about eight
feet high which joined  like a gum of rock  the roots of the two
monstrous teeth of the mountain  “id give a good deal to have a pair of
trousers on ” thought ransom to himself as he looked at it  the lady 
who was ahead  stood on tiptoe and raised her arms to catch a projection
on the lip of the ridge  then he saw her pull  apparently intending to
lift her whole weight on her arms and swing herself to the top in a
single movement  “look here  you cant do it that way ” he began 
speaking inadvertently in english  but before he had time to correct
himself she was standing on the edge above him  he did not see exactly
how it was done  but there was no sign that she had taken any unusual
exertion  his own climb was a less dignified affair  and it was a
panting and perspiring man with a smudge of blood on his knee who
finally stood beside her  she was inquisitive about the blood  and when
he had explained the phenomenon to her as well as he could  wanted to
scrape a little skin off her own knee to see if the same would happen 
this led him to try to explain to her what was meant by pain  which only
made her more anxious to try the experiment  but at the last moment
maleldil apparently told her not to 

ransom now turned to survey their surroundings  high overhead  and
seeming by perspective to lean inwards towards each other at the top and
almost to shut out the sky  rose the immense piers of rock—not two or
three of them  but nine  some of them  like those two between which they
had entered the circle  were close together  others were many yards
apart  they surrounded a roughly oval plateau of perhaps seven acres 
covered with a finer turf than any known on our planet and dotted with
tiny crimson flowers  a high  singing wind carried  as it were  a cooled
and refined quintessence of all the scents from the richer world below 
and kept these in continual agitation  glimpses of the far-spread sea 
visible between pillars  made one continually conscious of great height 
and ransoms eyes  long accustomed to the medley of curves and colours
in the floating islands  rested on the pure lines and stable masses of
this place with great refreshment  he took a few paces forward into the
cathedral spaciousness of the plateau  and when he spoke his voice woke
echoes 

“oh  this is good ” he said  “but perhaps you—you to whom it is
forbidden—do not feel it so ” but a glance at the ladys face told him
he was wrong  he did not know what was in her mind  but her face  as
once or twice before  seemed to shine with something before which he
dropped his eyes  “let us examine the sea ” she said presently 

they made the circle of the plateau methodically  behind them lay the
group of islands from which they had set out that morning  seen from
this altitude it was larger even than ransom had supposed  the richness
of its colours—its orange  its silver  its purple and  to his surprise 
its glossy blacks—made it seem almost heraldic  it was from this
direction that the wind came  the smell of those islands  though faint 
was like the sound of running water to a thirsty man  but on every other
side they saw nothing but the ocean  at least  they saw no islands  but
when they had made almost the whole circuit  ransom shouted and the lady
pointed almost at the same moment  about two miles off  dark against the
coppery-green of the water  there was some small round object  if he had
been looking down on an earthly sea ransom would have taken it  at first
sight  for a buoy 

“i do not know what it is ” said the lady  “unless it is the thing that
fell out of deep heaven this morning ”

“i wish i had a pair of field-glasses ” thought ransom  for the ladys
words had awakened in him a sudden suspicion  and the longer he stared
at the dark blob the more his suspicion was confirmed  it appeared to be
perfectly spherical  and he thought he had seen something like it
before 

you have already heard that ransom had been in that world which men call
mars but whose true name is malacandra  but he had not been taken
thither by the eldila  he had been taken by men  and taken in a
space-ship  a hollow sphere of glass and steel  he had  in fact  been
kidnapped by men who thought that the ruling powers of malacandra
demanded a human sacrifice  the whole thing had been a misunderstanding 
the great oyarsa who has governed mars from the beginning  and whom my
own eyes beheld  in a sense  in the hall of ransoms cottage  had done
him no harm and meant him none  but his chief captor  professor weston 
had meant plenty of harm  he was a man obsessed with the idea which is
at this moment circulating all over our planet in obscure works of
“scientifiction ” in little interplanetary societies and rocketry clubs 
and between the covers of monstrous magazines  ignored or mocked by the
intellectuals  but ready  if ever the power is put into its hands  to
open a new chapter of misery for the universe  it is the idea that
humanity  having now sufficiently corrupted the planet where it arose 
must at all costs contrive to seed itself over a larger area  that the
vast astronomical distances which are gods quarantine regulations  must
somehow be overcome  this for a start  but beyond this lies the sweet
poison of the false infinite—the wild dream that planet after planet 
system after system  in the end galaxy after galaxy  can be forced to
sustain  everywhere and for ever  the sort of life which is contained in
the loins of our own species—a dream begotten by the hatred of death
upon the fear of true immortality  fondled in secret by thousands of
ignorant men and hundreds who are not ignorant  the destruction or
enslavement of other species in the universe  if such there are  is to
these minds a welcome corollary  in professor weston the power had at
last met the dream  the great physicist had discovered a motive power
for his space-ship  and that little black object  now floating beneath
him on the sinless waters of perelandra  looked to ransom more like the
space-ship every moment  “so that ” he thought  “that is why i have been
sent here  he failed on malacandra and now he is coming here  and its
up to me to do something about it ” a terrible sense of inadequacy swept
over him  last time—in mars—weston had had only one accomplice  but he
had had firearms  and how many accomplices might he have this time  and
in mars he had been foiled not by ransom but by the eldila  and
specially the great eldil  the oyarsa  of that world  he turned quickly
to the lady 

“i have seen no eldila in your world ” he said 

“eldila ” she repeated as if it were a new name to her 

“yes  eldila ” said ransom  “the great and ancient servants of maleldil 
the creatures that neither breed nor breathe  whose bodies are made of
light  whom we can hardly see  who ought to be obeyed ”

she mused for a moment and then spoke  “sweetly and gently this time
maleldil makes me older  he shows me all the natures of these blessed
creatures  but there is no obeying them  now   not in this world  that
is all the old order  piebald  the far side of the wave that has rolled
past us and will not come again  that very ancient world to which you
journeyed was put under the eldila  in your own world also they ruled
once  but not since our beloved became a man  in your world they linger
still  but in our world  which is the first of worlds to wake after the
great change  they have no power  there is nothing now between us and
him  they have grown less and we have increased  and now maleldil puts
it into my mind that this is their glory and their joy  they received
us—us things of the low worlds  who breed and breathe—as weak and small
beasts whom their lightest touch could destroy  and their glory was to
cherish us and make us older till we were older than they—till they
could fall at our feet  it is a joy we shall not have  however i teach
the beasts they will never be better than i  but it is a joy beyond all 
not that it is better joy than ours  every joy is beyond all others  the
fruit we are eating is always the best fruit of all ”

“there have been eldila who did not think it a joy ” said ransom 

“how ”

“you spoke yesterday  lady  of clinging to the old good instead of
taking the good that came ”

“yes—for a few heart-beats ”

“there was an eldil who clung longer—who has been clinging since before
the worlds were made ”

“but the old good would cease to be a good at all if he did that ”

“yes  it has ceased  and still he clings ”

she stared at him in wonder and was about to speak  but he interrupted
her 

“there is no time to explain ” he said 

“no time  what has happened to the time ” she asked 

“listen ” he said  “that thing down there has come through deep heaven
from my world  there is a man in it  perhaps many men——”

“look ” she said  “it is turning into two—one big and one small ”

ransom saw that a small black object had detached itself from the
space-ship and was beginning to move uncertainly away from it  it
puzzled him for a moment  then it dawned on him that weston—if it was
weston—probably knew the watery surface he had to expect on venus and
had brought some kind of collapsible boat  but could it be that he had
not reckoned with tides or storms and did not foresee that it might be
impossible for him ever to recover the space-ship  it was not like
weston to cut off his own retreat  and ransom certainly did not wish
westons retreat to be cut off  a weston who could not  even if he
chose  return to earth  was an insoluble problem  anyway  what could he 
ransom  possibly do without support from the eldila  he began to smart
under a sense of injustice  what was the good of sending him—a mere
scholar—to cope with a situation of this sort  any ordinary pugilist 
or  better still  any man who could make good use of a tommy-gun  would
have been more to the purpose  if only they could find this king whom
the green woman kept on talking about       

but while these thoughts were passing through his mind he became aware
of a dim murmuring or growling sound which had gradually been
encroaching on the silence for some time  “look ” said the lady
suddenly  and pointed to the mass of islands  their surface was no
longer level  at the same moment he realised that the noise was that of
waves  small waves as yet  but definitely beginning to foam on the rocky
headlands of the fixed island  “the sea is rising ” said the lady  “we
must go down and leave this land at once  soon the waves will be too
great—and i must not be here by night ”

“not that way ” shouted ransom  “not where you will meet the man from my
world ”

“why ” said the lady  “i am lady and mother of this world  if the king
is not here  who else should greet a stranger ”

“i will meet him ”

“it is not your world  piebald ” she replied 

“you do not understand ” said ransom  “this man—he is a friend of that
eldil of whom i told you—one of those who cling to the wrong good ”

“then i must explain it to him ” said the lady  “let us go and make him
older ” and with that she slung herself down the rocky edge of the
plateau and began descending the mountain slope  ransom took longer to
manage the rocks  but once his feet were again on the turf he began
running as fast as he could  the lady cried out in surprise as he
flashed past her  but he took no notice  he could now see clearly which
bay the little boat was making for and his attention was fully occupied
in directing his course and making sure of his feet  there was only one
man in the boat  down and down the long slope he raced  now he was in a
fold  now in a winding valley which momentarily cut off the sight of the
sea  now at last he was in the cove itself  he glanced back and saw to
his dismay that the lady had also been running and was only a few yards
behind  he glanced forward again  there were waves  though not yet very
large ones  breaking on the pebbly beach  a man in shirt and shorts and
a pith helmet was ankle-deep in the water  wading ashore and pulling
after him a little canvas punt  it was certainly weston  though his face
had something about it which seemed subtly unfamiliar  it seemed to
ransom of vital importance to prevent a meeting between weston and the
lady  he had seen weston murder an inhabitant of malacandra  he turned
back  stretching out both arms to bar her way and shouting “go back ”
she was too near  for a second she was almost in his arms  then she
stood back from him  panting from the race  surprised  her mouth opened
to speak  but at that moment he heard westons voice  from behind him 
saying in english  “may i ask you  dr  ransom  what is the meaning of
this ”




                                 seven


in all the circumstances it would have been reasonable to expect that
weston would be much more taken aback at ransoms presence than ransom
could be at his  but if he were  he showed no sign of it  and ransom
could hardly help admiring the massive egoism which enabled this man in
the very moment of his arrival on an unknown world to stand there
unmoved in all his authoritative vulgarity  his arms akimbo  his face
scowling  and his feet planted as solidly on that unearthly soil as if
he had been standing with his back to the fire in his own study  then 
with a shock  he noticed that weston was speaking to the lady in the old
solar language with perfect fluency  on malacandra  partly from
incapacity  and much more from his contempt for the inhabitants  he had
never acquired more than a smattering of it  here was an inexplicable
and disquieting novelty  ransom felt that his only advantage had been
taken from him  he felt that he was now in the presence of the
incalculable  if the scales had been suddenly weighted in this one
respect  what might come next 

he awoke from his abstraction to find that weston and the lady had been
conversing fluently  but without mutual understanding  “it is no use ”
she was saying  “you and i are not old enough to speak together  it
seems  the sea is rising  let us go back to the islands  will he come
with us  piebald ”

“where are the two fishes ” said ransom 

“they will be waiting in the next bay ” said the lady 

“quick  then ” said ransom to her  and then  in answer to her look  “no 
he will not come ” she did not  presumably  understand his urgency  but
her eye was on the sea and she understood her own reason for haste  she
had already begun to ascend the side of the valley  with ransom
following her  when weston shouted  “no  you dont ” ransom turned and
found himself covered by a revolver  the sudden heat which swept over
his body was the only sign by which he knew that he was frightened  his
head remained clear 

“are you going to begin in this world also by murdering one of its
inhabitants ” he asked 

“what are you saying ” asked the lady  pausing and looking back at the
two men with a puzzled  tranquil face 

“stay where you are  ransom ” said the professor  “that native can go
where she likes  the sooner the better ”

ransom was about to implore her to make good her escape when he realised
that no imploring was needed  he had irrationally supposed that she
would understand the situation  but apparently she saw nothing more than
two strangers talking about something which she did not at the moment
understand—that  and her own necessity of leaving the fixed land at
once 

“you and he do not come with me  piebald ” she asked 

“no ” said ransom  without turning round  “it may be that you and i
shall not meet soon again  greet the king for me if you find him and
speak of me always to maleldil  i stay here ”

“we shall meet when maleldil pleases ” she answered  “or if not  some
greater good will happen to us instead ” then he heard her footsteps
behind him for a few seconds  and then he heard them no more and knew he
was alone with weston 

“you allowed yourself to use the word murder just now  dr  ransom ” said
the professor  “in reference to an accident that occurred when we were
in malacandra  in any case  the creature killed was not a human being 
allow me to tell you that i consider the seduction of a native girl as
an almost equally unfortunate way of introducing civilisation to a new
planet ”

“seduction ” said ransom  “oh  i see  you thought i was making love to
her ”

“when i find a naked civilised man embracing a naked savage woman in a
solitary place  that is the name i give to it ”

“i wasnt embracing her ” said ransom dully  for the whole business of
defending himself on this score seemed at that moment a mere weariness
of the spirit  “and no one wears clothes here  but what does it matter 
get on with the job that brings you to perelandra ”

“you ask me to believe that you have been living here with that woman
under these conditions in a state of sexless innocence ”

“oh  sexless ” said ransom disgustedly  “all right  if you like  its
about as good a description of living in perelandra as it would be to
say that a man had forgotten water because niagara falls didnt
immediately give him the idea of making it into cups of tea  but youre
right enough if you mean that i have had no more thought of desiring her
than—than      ” comparisons failed him and his voice died  then he
began again  “but dont say im asking you to believe it  or to believe
anything  i am asking you nothing but to begin and end as soon as
possible whatever butcheries and robberies you have come to do ”

weston eyed him for a moment with a curious expression  then 
unexpectedly  he turned his revolver to its holster 

“ransom ” he said  “you do me a great injustice ”

for several seconds there was silence between them  long breakers with
white woolpacks of foam on them were now rolling into the cove exactly
as on earth 

“yes ” said weston at last  “and i will begin with a frank admission 
you may make what capital of it you please  i shall not be deterred  i
deliberately say that i was  in some respects  mistaken—seriously
mistaken—in my conception of the whole interplanetary problem when i
went to malacandra ”

partly from the relaxation which followed the disappearance of the
pistol  and partly from the elaborate air of magnanimity with which the
great scientist spoke  ransom felt very much inclined to laugh  but it
occurred to him that this was possibly the first occasion in his whole
life in which weston had ever acknowledged himself in the wrong  and
that even the false dawn of humility  which is still ninety-nine per
cent  of arrogance  ought not to be rebuffed—or not by him 

“well  thats very handsome ” he said  “how do you mean ”

“ill tell you presently ” said weston  “in the meantime i must get my
things ashore ” between them they beached the punt  and began carrying
westons primus-stove and tins and tent and other packages to a spot
about two hundred yards inland  ransom  who knew all the paraphernalia
to be needless  made no objection  and in about a quarter of an hour
something like an encampment had been established in a mossy place under
some blue-trunked silver-leaved trees beside a rivulet  both men sat
down and ransom listened at first with interest  then with amazement 
and finally with incredulity  weston cleared his throat  threw out his
chest  and assumed his lecturing manner  throughout the conversation
that followed  ransom was filled with a sense of crazy irrelevance  here
were two human beings  thrown together in an alien world under
conditions of inconceivable strangeness  the one separated from his
space-ship  the other newly released from the threat of instant death 
was it sane—was it imaginable—that they should find themselves at once
engaged in a philosophical argument which might just as well have
occurred in a cambridge combination room  yet that  apparently  was what
weston insisted upon  he showed no interest in the fate of his
space-ship  he even seemed to feel no curiosity about ransoms presence
on venus  could it be that he had travelled more than thirty million
miles of space in search of—conversation  but as he went on talking 
ransom felt himself more and more in the presence of a monomaniac  like
an actor who cannot think of anything but his celebrity  or a lover who
can think of nothing but his mistress  tense  tedious  and unescapable 
the scientist pursued his fixed idea 

“the tragedy of my life ” he said  “and indeed of the modern
intellectual world in general  is the rigid specialisation of knowledge
entailed by the growing complexity of what is known  it is my own share
in that tragedy that an early devotion to physics has prevented me from
paying any proper attention to biology until i reached the fifties  to
do myself justice  i should make it clear that the false humanist ideal
of knowledge as an end in itself never appealed to me  i always wanted
to know in order to achieve utility  at first  that utility naturally
appeared to me in a personal form—i wanted scholarships  an income  and
that generally recognised position in the world without which a man has
no leverage  when those were attained  i began to look farther  to the
utility of the human race ”

he paused as he rounded his period and ransom nodded to him to proceed 

“the utility of the human race ” continued weston  “in the long run
depends rigidly on the possibility of inter-planetary  and even
inter-sidereal  travel  that problem i solved  the key of human destiny
was placed in my hands  it would be unnecessary—and painful to us
both—to remind you how it was wrenched from me in malacandra by a member
of a hostile intelligent species whose existence  i admit  i had not
anticipated ”

“not hostile exactly ” said ransom  “but go on ”

“the rigours of our return journey from malacandra led to a serious
breakdown in my health——”

“mine too ” said ransom 

weston looked somewhat taken aback at the interruption and went on 
“during my convalescence i had that leisure for reflection which i had
denied myself for many years  in particular i reflected on the
objections you had felt to that liquidation of the non-human inhabitants
of malacandra which was  of course  the necessary preliminary to its
occupation by our own species  the traditional and  if i may say so  the
humanitarian form in which you advanced those objections had till then
concealed from me their true strength  that strength i now began to
perceive  i began to see that my own exclusive devotion to human utility
was really based on an unconscious dualism ”

“what do you mean ”

“i mean that all my life i had been making a wholly unscientific
dichotomy or antithesis between man and nature—had conceived myself
fighting  for  man against his non-human environment  during my illness
i plunged into biology  and particularly into what may be called
biological philosophy  hitherto  as a physicist  i had been content to
regard life as a subject outside my scope  the conflicting views of
those who drew a sharp line between the organic and the inorganic and
those who held that what we call life was inherent in matter from the
very beginning had not interested me  now it did  i saw almost at once
that i could admit no break  no discontinuity  in the unfolding of the
cosmic process  i became a convinced believer in emergent evolution  all
is one  the stuff of mind  the unconsciously purposive dynamism  is
present from the very beginning ”

here he paused  ransom had heard this sort of thing pretty often before
and wondered when his companion was coming to the point  when weston
resumed it was with an even deeper solemnity of tone 

“the majestic spectacle of this blind  inarticulate purposiveness
thrusting its way upward and ever upward in an endless unity of
differentiated achievements towards an ever-increasing complexity of
organisation  towards spontaneity and spirituality  swept away all my
old conception of a duty to man as such  man in himself is nothing  the
forward movement of life—the growing spirituality—is everything  i say
to you quite freely  ransom  that i should have been wrong in
liquidating the malacandrians  it was a mere prejudice that made me
prefer our own race to theirs  to spread spirituality  not to spread the
human race  is henceforth my mission  this sets the coping-stone on my
career  i worked first for myself  then for science  then for humanity 
but now at last for spirit itself—i might say  borrowing language which
will be more familiar to you  the holy spirit ”

“now what exactly do you mean by that ” asked ransom 

“i mean ” said weston  “that nothing now divides you and me except a few
outworn theological technicalities with which organised religion has
unhappily allowed itself to get incrusted  but i have penetrated that
crust  the meaning beneath it is as true and living as ever  if you will
excuse me for putting it that way  the essential truth of the religious
view of life finds a remarkable witness in the fact that it enabled you 
on malacandra  to grasp  in your own mythical and imaginative fashion  a
truth which was hidden from me ”

“i dont know much about what people call the religious view of life ”
said ransom  wrinkling his brow  “you see  im a christian  and what we
mean by the holy ghost is  not  a blind  inarticulate purposiveness ”

“my dear ransom ” said weston  “i understand you perfectly  i have no
doubt that my phraseology will seem strange to you  and perhaps even
shocking  early and revered associations may have put it out of your
power to recognise in this new form the very same truths which religion
has so long preserved and which science is now at last re-discovering 
but whether you can see it or not  believe me  we are talking about
exactly the same thing ”

“im not at all sure that we are ”

“that  if you will permit me to say so  is one of the real weaknesses of
organised religion—that adherence to formulæ  that failure to recognise
ones own friends  god is a spirit  ransom  get hold of that  youre
familiar with that already  stick to it  god is a spirit ”

“well  of course  but what then ”

“what then  why  spirit—mind—freedom—spontaneity—thats what im talking
about  that is the goal towards which the whole cosmic process is
moving  the final disengagement of that freedom  that spirituality  is
the work to which i dedicate my own life and the life of humanity  the
goal  ransom  the goal  think of it   pure  spirit  the final vortex of
self-thinking  self-originating activity ”

“final ” said ransom  “you mean it doesnt yet exist ”

“ah ” said weston  “i see whats bothering you  of course i know 
religion pictures it as being there from the beginning  but surely that
is not a real difference  to make it one  would be to take time too
seriously  when it has once been attained  you might then say it had
been at the beginning just as well as at the end  time is one of the
things it will transcend ”

“by the way ” said ransom  “is it in any sense at all personal—is it
alive ”

an indescribable expression passed over westons face  he moved a little
nearer to ransom and began speaking in a lower voice 

“thats what none of them understand ” he said  it was such a gangsters
or a schoolboys whisper and so unlike his usual orotund lecturing style
that ransom for a moment felt a sensation almost of disgust 

“yes ” said weston  “i couldnt have believed  myself  till recently 
not a person  of course  anthropomorphism is one of the childish
diseases of popular religion”  here he had resumed his public manner  
“but the opposite extreme of excessive abstraction has perhaps in the
aggregate proved more disastrous  call it a force  a great  inscrutable
force  pouring up into us from the dark bases of being  a force that can
choose its instruments  it is only lately  ransom  that ive learned
from actual experience something which you have believed all your life
as part of your religion ” here he suddenly subsided again into a
whisper—a croaking whisper unlike his usual voice  “guided ” he said 
“chosen  guided  ive become conscious that im a man set apart  why did
i do physics  why did i discover the weston rays  why did i go to
malacandra  it—the force—has pushed me on all the time  im being
guided  i know now that i am the greatest scientist the world has yet
produced  ive been made so for a purpose  it is through me that spirit
itself is at this moment pushing on to its goal ”

“look here ” said ransom  “one wants to be careful about this sort of
thing  there are spirits and spirits you know ”

“eh ” said weston  “what are you talking about ”

“i mean a thing might be a spirit and not good for you ”

“but i thought you agreed that spirit was the good—the end of the whole
process  i thought you religious people were all out for spirituality 
what is the point of asceticism—fasts and celibacy and all that  didnt
we agree that god is a spirit  dont you worship him because he is pure
spirit ”

“good heavens  no  we worship him because he is wise and good  theres
nothing specially fine about simply being a spirit  the devil is a
spirit ”

“now your mentioning the devil is very interesting ” said weston  who
had by this time quite recovered his normal manner  “it is a most
interesting thing in popular religion  this tendency to fissiparate  to
breed pairs of opposites  heaven and hell  god and devil  i need hardly
say that in my view no real dualism in the universe is admissible  and
on that ground i should have been disposed  even a few weeks ago  to
reject these pairs of doublets as pure mythology  it would have been a
profound error  the cause of this universal religious tendency is to be
sought much deeper  the doublets are really portraits of spirit  of
cosmic energy—self-portraits  indeed—for it is the life-force itself
which has deposited them in our brains ”

“what on earth do you mean ” said ransom  as he spoke he rose to his
feet and began pacing to and fro  a quite appalling weariness and
malaise had descended upon him 

“ your  devil and  your  god ” said weston  “are both pictures of the
same force  your heaven is a picture of the perfect spirituality ahead 
your hell a picture of the urge or  nisus  which is driving us on to it
from behind  hence the static peace of the one and the fire and darkness
of the other  the next stage of emergent evolution  beckoning us
forward  is god  the transcended stage behind  ejecting us  is the
devil  your own religion  after all  says that the devils are fallen
angels ”

“and you are saying precisely the opposite  as far as i can make
out—that angels are devils whove risen in the world ”

“it comes to the same thing ” said weston 

there was another long pause  “look here ” said ransom  “its easy to
misunderstand one another on a point like this  what you are saying
sounds to me like the most horrible mistake a man could fall into  but
that may be because in the effort to accommodate it to my supposed
religious views  youre saying a good deal more than you mean  its
only a metaphor  isnt it  all this about spirits and forces  i expect
all you really mean is that you feel it your duty to work for the spread
of civilisation and knowledge and that kind of thing ” he had tried to
keep out of his voice the involuntary anxiety which he had begun to
feel  next moment he recoiled in horror at the cackling laughter  almost
an infantile or senile laughter  with which weston replied 

“there you go  there you go ” he said  “like all you religious people 
you talk and talk about these things all your life  and the moment you
meet the reality you get frightened ”

“what proof ” said ransom  who indeed did feel frightened   “what proof
have you that you are being guided or supported by anything except your
own individual mind and other peoples books ”

“you didnt notice  dear ransom ” said weston  “that id improved a bit
since we last met in my knowledge of extra-terrestrial language  you are
a philologist  they tell me ”

ransom started  “how did you do it ” he blurted out 

“guidance  you know  guidance ” croaked weston  he was squatting at the
roots of his tree with his knees drawn up  and his face  now the colour
of putty  wore a fixed and even slightly twisted grin  “guidance 
guidance ” he went on  “things coming into my head  im being prepared
all the time  being made a fit receptacle for it ”

“that ought to be fairly easy ” said ransom impatiently  “if this
life-force is something so ambiguous that god and the devil are equally
good portraits of it  i suppose any receptacle is equally fit  and
anything you can do is equally an expression of it ”

“theres such a thing as the main current ” said weston  “its a
question of surrendering yourself to that—making yourself the conductor
of the live  fiery  central purpose—becoming the very finger with which
it reaches forward ”

“but i thought that was the devil aspect of it  a moment ago ”

“that is the fundamental paradox  the thing we are reaching forward to
is what you would call god  the reaching forward  the dynamism  is what
people like you always call the devil  the people like me  who do the
reaching forward  are always martyrs  you revile us  and by us come to
your goal ”

“does that mean in plainer language that the things the force wants you
to do are what ordinary people call diabolical ”

“my dear ransom  i wish you would not keep relapsing on to the popular
level  the two things are only moments in the single  unique reality 
the world leaps forward through great men and greatness always
transcends mere moralism  when the leap has been made our diabolism as
you would call it becomes the morality of the next stage  but while we
are making it  we are called criminals  heretics  blasphemers       ”

“how far does it go  would you still obey the life-force if you found it
prompting you to murder me ”

“yes ”

“or to sell england to the germans ”

“yes ”

“or to print lies as serious research in a scientific periodical ”

“yes ”

“god help you ” said ransom 

“you are still wedded to your conventionalities ” said weston  “still
dealing in abstractions  can you not even conceive a total commitment—a
commitment to something which utterly overrides all our petty ethical
pigeon-holes ”

ransom grasped at the straw  “wait  weston ” he said abruptly  “that may
be a point of contact  you say its a total commitment  that is  youre
giving up yourself  youre not out for your own advantage  no  wait half
a second  this  is  the point of contact between your morality and mine 
we both acknowledge——”

“idiot ” said weston  his voice was almost a howl and he had risen to
his feet  “idiot ” he repeated  “can you understand nothing  will you
always try to press everything back into the miserable framework of your
old jargon about self and self-sacrifice  that is the old accursed
dualism in another form  there is no possible distinction in concrete
thought between me and the universe  in so far as i am the conductor of
the central forward pressure of the universe  i am it  do you see  you
timid  scruple-mongering fool  i  am  the universe  i  weston  am your
god and your devil  i call that force into me completely       ”

then horrible things began happening  a spasm like that preceding a
deadly vomit twisted westons face out of recognition  as it passed  for
one second something like the old weston reappeared—the old weston 
staring with eyes of horror and howling  “ransom  ransom  for christs
sake dont let them——” and instantly his whole body spun round as if he
had been hit by a revolver-bullet and he fell to the earth  and was
there rolling at ransoms feet  slavering and chattering and tearing up
the moss by handfuls  gradually the convulsions decreased  he lay still 
breathing heavily  his eyes open but without expression  ransom was
kneeling beside him now  it was obvious that the body was alive  and
ransom wondered whether this were a stroke or an epileptic fit  for he
had never seen either  he rummaged among the packages and found a bottle
of brandy which he uncorked and applied to the patients mouth  to his
consternation the teeth opened  closed on the neck of the bottle and bit
it through  no glass was spat out  “o god  ive killed him ” said
ransom  but beyond a spurt of blood at the lips there was no change in
his appearance  the face suggested that either he was in no pain or in a
pain beyond all human comprehension  ransom rose at last  but before
doing so he plucked the revolver from westons belt  then  walking down
to the beach  he threw it as far as he could into the sea 

he stood for some moments gazing out upon the bay and undecided what to
do  presently he turned and climbed up the turfy ridge that bordered the
little valley on his left hand  he found himself on a fairly level
upland with a good view of the sea  now running high and teased out of
its level gold into a continually changing pattern of lights and
shadows  for a second or two he could catch no sight of the islands 
then suddenly their tree-tops appeared  hanging high up against the sky 
and widely separated  the weather  apparently  was already driving them
apart—and even as he thought this they vanished once more into some
unseen valley of the waves  what was his chance  he wondered  of ever
finding them again  a sense of loneliness smote him  and then a feeling
of angry frustration  if weston were dying  or even if weston were to
live  imprisoned here with him on an island they could not leave  what
had been the danger he was sent to avert from perelandra  and so  having
begun to think of himself  he realised that he was hungry  he had seen
neither fruit nor gourd on the fixed land  perhaps it was a death trap 
he smiled bitterly at the folly which had made him so glad  that
morning  to exchange those floating paradises  where every grove dropped
sweetness  for this barren rock  but perhaps it was not barren after
all  determined  despite the weariness which was every moment descending
upon him  to make a search for food  he was just turning inland when the
swift changes of colour that announce the evening of that world overtook
him  uselessly he quickened his pace  before he had got down into the
valley  the grove where he had left weston was a mere cloud of darkness 
before he had reached it he was in seamless  undimensioned night  an
effort or two to grope his way to the place where westons stores had
been deposited only served to abolish his sense of direction altogether 
he sat down perforce  he called westons name aloud once or twice but 
as he expected  received no answer  “im glad i removed his gun  all the
same ” thought ransom  and then  “well   qui dort dîne  and i suppose i
must make the best of it till the morning ” when he lay down he
discovered that the solid earth and moss of the fixed land was very much
less comfortable than the surfaces to which he had lately been
accustomed  that  and the thought of the other human being lying  no
doubt  close at hand with open eyes and teeth clenched on splintered
glass  and the sullen recurring pound of breakers on the beach  all made
the night comfortless  “if i lived on perelandra ” he muttered 
“maleldil wouldnt need to  forbid  this island  i wish id never set
eyes on it ”




                                 eight


he woke  after a disturbed and dreamful sleep  in full daylight  he had
a dry mouth  a crick in his neck  and a soreness in his limbs  it was so
unlike all previous wakings in the world of venus  that for a moment he
supposed himself back on earth  and the dream  for so it seemed to him 
of having lived and walked on the oceans of the morning star rushed
through his memory with a sense of lost sweetness that was well-nigh
unbearable  then he sat up and the facts came back to him  “its jolly
nearly the same as having waked from a dream  though ” he thought 
hunger and thirst became at once his dominant sensations  but he
conceived it a duty to look first at the sick man—though with very
little hope that he could help him  he gazed round  there was the grove
of silvery trees all right  but he could not see weston  then he glanced
at the bay  there was no punt either  assuming that in the darkness he
had blundered into the wrong valley  he rose and approached the stream
for a drink  as he lifted his face from the water with a long sigh of
satisfaction  his eyes suddenly fell on a little wooden box—and then
beyond it on a couple of tins  his brain was working rather slowly and
it took him a few seconds to realise that he was in the right valley
after all  and a few more to draw conclusions from the fact that the box
was open and empty  and that some of the stores had been removed and
others left behind  but was it possible that a man in westons physical
condition could have recovered sufficiently during the night to strike
camp and to go away laden with some kind of pack  was it possible that
any man could have faced a sea like that in a collapsible punt  it was
true  as he now noticed for the first time  that the storm  which had
been a mere squall by perelandrian standards  appeared to have blown
itself out during the night  but there was still a quite formidable
swell and it seemed out of the question that the professor could have
left the island  much more probably he had left the valley on foot and
carried the punt with him  ransom decided that he must find weston at
once  he must keep in touch with his enemy  for if weston had recovered 
there was no doubt he meant mischief of some kind  ransom was not at all
certain that he had understood all his wild talk on the previous day 
but what he did understand he disliked very much  and suspected that
this vague mysticism about “spirituality” would turn out to be something
even nastier than his old and comparatively simple programme of
planetary imperialism  it would be unfair to take seriously the things
the man had said immediately before his seizure  no doubt  but there was
enough without that 

the next few hours ransom passed in searching the island for food and
for weston  as far as food was concerned  he was rewarded  some fruit
like bilberries could be gathered in handfuls on the upper slopes  and
the wooded valleys abounded in a kind of oval nut  the kernel had a
toughly soft consistency  rather like cork or kidneys  and the flavour 
though somewhat austere and prosaic after the fruit of the floating
islands  was not unsatisfactory  the giant mice were as tame as other
perelandrian beasts but seemed stupider  ransom ascended to the central
plateau  the sea was dotted with islands in every direction  rising and
falling with the swell  and all separated from one another by wide
stretches of water  his eye at once picked out an orange-coloured
island  but he did not know whether it was that on which he had been
living  for he saw at least two others in which the same colour
predominated  at one time he counted twenty-three floating islands in
all  that  he thought  was more than the temporary archipelago had
contained  and allowed him to hope that any one of those he saw might
hide the king—or that the king might even at this moment be re-united to
the lady  without thinking it out very clearly  he had come to rest
almost all his hopes on the king 

of weston he could find no trace  it really did seem  in spite of all
improbabilities  that he had somehow contrived to leave the fixed
island  and ransoms anxiety was very great  what weston  in his new
vein  might do  he had no idea  the best to hope for was that he would
simply ignore the master and mistress of perelandra as mere savages or
“natives ”

late in the day  being tired  he sat down on the shore  there was very
little swell now and the waves  just before they broke  were less than
knee-deep  his feet  made soft by the mattress-like surface which one
walks on in those floating islands  were hot and sore  presently he
decided to refresh them by a little wading  the delicious quality of the
water drew him out till he was waist-deep  as he stood there  deep in
thought  he suddenly perceived that what he had taken to be an effect of
light on the water was really the back of one of the great silvery fish 
“i wonder would it let me ride it ” he thought  and then  watching how
the beast nosed towards him and kept itself as near the shallows as it
dared  it was borne in upon him that it was trying to attract his
attention  could it have been  sent   the thought had no sooner darted
through his mind than he decided to make the experiment  he laid his
hand across the creatures back  and it did not flinch from his touch 
then with some difficulty he scrambled into a sitting position across
the narrow part behind its head  and while he was doing this it remained
as nearly stationary as it could  but as soon as he was firmly in the
saddle it whisked itself about and headed for the sea 

if he had wished to withdraw  it was very soon impossible to do so 
already the green pinnacles of the mountain  as he looked back  had
withdrawn their summits from the sky and the coastline of the island had
begun to conceal its bays and nesses  the breakers were no longer
audible—only the prolonged sibilant or chattering noises of the water
about him  many floating islands were visible  though seen from this
level they were mere feathery silhouettes  but the fish seemed to be
heading for none of these  straight on  as if it well knew its way  the
beat of the great fins carried him for more than an hour  then green and
purple splashed the whole world  and after that darkness 

somehow he felt hardly any uneasiness when he found himself swiftly
climbing and descending the low hills of water through the black night 
and here it was not all black  the heavens had vanished  and the surface
of the sea  but far  far below him in the heart of the vacancy through
which he appeared to be travelling  strange bursting star shells and
writhing streaks of a bluish-green luminosity appeared  at first they
were very remote  but soon  as far as he could judge  they were nearer 
a whole world of phosphorescent creatures seemed to be at play not far
from the surface—coiling eels and darting things in complete armour  and
then heraldically fantastic shapes to which the sea-horse of our own
waters would be commonplace  they were all round him—twenty or thirty of
them often in sight at once  and mixed with all this riot of
sea-centaurs and sea-dragons he saw yet stranger forms  fishes  if
fishes they were  whose forward part was so nearly human in shape that
when he first caught sight of them he thought he had fallen into a dream
and shook himself to awake  but it was no dream  there—and there
again—it was unmistakable  now a shoulder  now a profile  and then for
one second a full face  veritable mermen or mermaids  the resemblance to
humanity was indeed greater  not less  than he had first supposed  what
had for a moment concealed it from him was the total absence of human
expression  yet the faces were not idiotic  they were not even brutal
parodies of humanity like those of our terrestrial apes  they were more
like human faces asleep  or faces in which humanity slept while some
other life  neither bestial nor diabolic  but merely elvish  out of our
orbit  was irrelevantly awake  he remembered his old suspicion that what
was myth in one world might always be fact in some other  he wondered
also whether the king and queen of perelandra  though doubtless the
first human pair of this planet  might on the physical side have a
marine ancestry  and if so  what then of the man-like things before men
in our own world  must they in truth have been the wistful brutalities
whose pictures we see in popular books on evolution  or were the old
myths truer than the modern myths  had there in truth been a time when
satyrs danced in the italian woods  but he said “hush” to his mind at
this stage  for the mere pleasure of breathing in the fragrance which
now began to steal towards him from the blackness ahead  warm and sweet 
and every moment sweeter and purer  and every moment stronger and more
filled with all delights  it came to him  he knew well what it was  he
would know it henceforward out of the whole universe—the night-breath of
a floating island in the star venus  it was strange to be filled with
homesickness for places where his sojourn had been so brief and which
were  by any objective standard  so alien to all our race  or were they 
the cord of longing which drew him to the invisible isle seemed to him
at that moment to have been fastened long  long before his coming to
perelandra  long before the earliest times that memory could recover in
his childhood  before his birth  before the birth of man himself  before
the origins of time  it was sharp  sweet  wild  and holy  all in one 
and in any world where mens nerves have ceased to obey their central
desires would doubtless have been aphrodisiac too  but not in
perelandra  the fish was no longer moving  ransom put out his hand  he
found he was touching weed  he crawled forward over the head of the
monstrous fish  and levered himself on to the gently moving surface of
the island  short as his absence from such places had been  his
earth-trained habits of walking had reasserted themselves  and he fell
more than once as he groped his way on the heaving lawn  but it did no
harm falling here  good luck to it  there were trees all about him in
the dark and when a smooth  cool  rounded object came away in his hand
he put it  unfearing  to his lips  it was none of the fruits he had
tasted before  it was better than any of them  well might the lady say
of her world that the fruit you ate at any moment was  at that moment 
the best  wearied with his days walking and climbing  and  still more 
borne down by absolute satisfaction  he sank into dreamless sleep 

he felt that it was several hours later when he awoke and found himself
still in darkness  he knew  too  that he had been suddenly waked  and a
moment later he was listening to the sound that had waked him  it was
the sound of voices—a mans voice and a womans in earnest conversation 
he judged that they were very close to him—for in a perelandrian night
an object is no more visible six inches than six miles away  he
perceived at once who the speakers were  but the voices sounded strange 
and the emotions of the speakers were obscure to him  with no facial
expression to eke them out 

“i am wondering ” said the womans voice  “whether all the people of
your world have the habit of talking about the same thing more than
once  i have said already that we are forbidden to dwell on the fixed
land  why do you not either talk of something else or stop talking ”

“because this forbidding is such a strange one ” said the mans voice 
“and so unlike the ways of maleldil in my world  and he has not
forbidden you to think about dwelling on the fixed land ”

“that would be a strange thing—to think about what will never happen ”

“nay  in our world we do it all the time  we put words together to mean
things that have never happened and places that never were  beautiful
words  well put together  and then tell them to one another  we call it
stories or poetry  in that old world you spoke of  malacandra  they did
the same  it is for mirth and wonder and wisdom ”

“what is the wisdom in it ”

“because the world is made up not only of what is but of what might be 
maleldil knows both and wants us to know both ”

“this is more than i ever thought of  the other—the piebald one—has
already told me things which made me feel like a tree whose branches
were growing wider and wider apart  but this goes beyond all  stepping
out of what is into what might be and talking and making things out
there       alongside the world  i will ask the king what he thinks of
it ”

“you see  that is what we always come back to  if only you had not been
parted from the king ”

“oh  i see  that also is one of the things that might be  the world
might be so made that the king and i were never parted ”

“the world would not have to be different—only the way you live  in a
world where people live on the fixed lands they do not become suddenly
separated ”

“but you remember we are not to live on the fixed land ”

“no  but he has never forbidden you to think about it  might not that be
one of the reasons why you are forbidden to do it—so that you may have a
might be to think about  to make story about as we call it ”

“i will think more of this  i will get the king to make me older about
it ”

“how greatly i desire to meet this king of yours  but in the matter of
stories he may be no older than you himself ”

“that saying of yours is like a tree with no fruit  the king is always
older than i  and about all things ”

“but piebald and i have already made you older about certain matters
which the king never mentioned to you  that is the new good which you
never expected  you thought you would always learn all things from the
king  but now maleldil has sent you other men whom it had never entered
your mind to think of and they have told you things the king himself
could not know ”

“i begin to see now why the king and i were parted at this time  this is
a strange and great good he intended for me ”

“and if you refused to learn things from me and kept on saying you would
wait and ask the king  would that not be like turning away from the
fruit you had found to the fruit you had expected ”

“these are deep questions  stranger  maleldil is not putting much into
my mind about them ”

“do you not see why ”

“no ”

“since piebald and i have come to your world we have put many things
into your mind which maleldil has not  do you not see that he is letting
go of your hand a little ”

“how could he  he is wherever we go ”

“yes  but in another way  he is making you older—making you to learn
things not straight from him but by your own meetings with other people
and your own questions and thoughts ”

“he is certainly doing that ”

“yes  he is making you a full woman  for up till now you were only half
made—like the beasts who do nothing of themselves  this time  when you
meet the king again  it is you who will have things to tell him  it is
you who will be older than he and who will make him older ”

“maleldil would not make a thing like that happen  it would be like a
fruit with no taste ”

“but it would have a taste for  him   do you not think the king must
sometimes be tired of being the older  would he not love you more if you
were wiser than he ”

“is this what you call a poetry or do you mean that it really is ”

“i mean a thing that really is ”

“but how could anyone love anything more  it is like saying a thing
could be bigger than itself ”

“i only meant you could become more like the women of my world ”

“what are they like ”

“they are of a great spirit  they always reach out their hands for the
new and unexpected good  and see that it is good long before the men
understand it  their minds run ahead of what maleldil has told them 
they do not need to wait for him to tell them what is good  but know it
for themselves as he does  they are  as it were  little maleldils  and
because of their wisdom  their beauty is as much greater than yours as
the sweetness of these gourds surpasses the taste of water  and because
of their beauty the love which the men have for them is as much greater
than the kings love for you as the naked burning of deep heaven seen
from my world is more wonderful than the golden roof of yours ”

“i wish i could see them ”

“i wish you could ”

“how beautiful is maleldil and how wonderful are all his works  perhaps
he will bring out of me daughters as much greater than i as i am greater
than the beasts  it will be better than i thought  i had thought i was
to be always queen and lady  but i see now that i may be as the eldila 
i may be appointed to cherish when they are small and weak children who
will grow up and overtop me and at whose feet i shall fall  i see it is
not only questions and thoughts that grow out wider and wider like
branches  joy also widens out and comes where we had never thought ”

“i will sleep now ” said the other voice  as it said this it became  for
the first time  unmistakably the voice of weston—and of weston
disgruntled and snappish  up till now ransom  though constantly
resolving to join the conversation  had been kept silent in a kind of
suspense between two conflicting states of mind  on the one hand he was
certain  both from the voice and from many of the things it said  that
the male speaker was weston  on the other hand  the voice  divided from
the mans appearance  sounded curiously unlike itself  still more  the
patient persistent manner in which it was used was very unlike the
professors usual alternation between pompous lecturing and abrupt
bullying  and how could a man fresh from such a physical crisis as he
had seen weston undergo have recovered such mastery of himself in a few
hours  and how could he have reached the floating island  ransom had
found himself throughout their dialogue confronted with an intolerable
contradiction  something which was and was not weston was talking  and
the sense of this monstrosity  only a few feet away in the darkness  had
sent thrills of exquisite horror tingling along his spine  and raised
questions in his mind which he tried to dismiss as fantastic  now that
the conversation was over he realised  too  with what intense anxiety he
had followed it  at the same moment he was conscious of a sense of
triumph  but it was not he who was triumphant  the whole darkness about
him rang with victory  he started and half raised himself  had there
been any actual sound  listening hard he could hear nothing but the low
murmurous noise of warm wind and gentle swell  the suggestion of music
must have been from within  but as soon as he lay down again he felt
assured that it was not  from without  most certainly from without  but
not by the sense of hearing  festal revelry and dance and splendour
poured into him—no sound  yet in such fashion that it could not be
remembered or thought of except as music  it was like having a new
sense  it was like being present when the morning stars sang together 
it was as if perelandra had that moment been created—and perhaps in some
sense it had  the feeling of a great disaster averted was forced upon
his mind  and with it came the hope that there would be no second
attempt  and then  sweeter than all  the suggestion that he had been
brought there not to do anything but only as a spectator or a witness  a
few minutes later he was asleep 




                                  nine


the weather had changed during the night  ransom sat looking out from
the edge of the forest in which he had slept  on a flat sea where there
were no other islands in view  he had waked a few minutes before and
found himself lying alone in a close thicket of stems that were rather
reed-like in character but stout as those of birch trees and which
carried an almost flat roof of thick foliage  from this there hung
fruits as smooth and bright and round as holly-berries  some of which he
ate  then he found his way to open country near the skirts of the island
and looked about him  neither weston nor the lady was in sight  and he
began walking in a leisurely fashion beside the sea  his bare feet sank
a little into a carpet of saffron-coloured vegetation  which covered
them with an aromatic dust  as he was looking down at this he suddenly
noticed something else  at first he thought it was a creature of more
fantastic shape than he had yet seen on perelandra  its shape was not
only fantastic but hideous  then he dropped on one knee to examine it 
finally he touched it  with reluctance  a moment later he drew back his
hands like a man who had touched a snake 

it was a damaged animal  it was  or had been  one of the brightly
coloured frogs  but some accident had happened to it  the whole back had
been ripped open in a sort of v-shaped gash  the point of the v being a
little behind the head  something had torn a widening wound backward—as
we do in opening an envelope—along the trunk and pulled it out so far
behind the animal that the hoppers or hind legs had been almost torn off
with it  they were so damaged that the frog could not leap  on earth it
would have been merely a nasty sight  but up to this moment ransom had
as yet seen nothing dead or spoiled in perelandra  and it was like a
blow in the face  it was like the first spasm of well-remembered pain
warning a man who had thought he was cured that his family have deceived
him and he is dying after all  it was like the first lie from the mouth
of a friend on whose truth one was willing to stake a thousand pounds 
it was irrevocable  the milk-warm wind blowing over the golden sea  the
blues and silvers and greens of the floating garden  the sky itself—all
these had become  in one instant  merely the illuminated margin of a
book whose text was the struggling little horror at his feet  and he
himself  in that same instant  had passed into a state of emotion which
he could neither control nor understand  he told himself that a creature
of that kind probably had very little sensation  but it did not much
mend matters  it was not merely pity for pain that had suddenly changed
the rhythm of his heart-beats  the thing was an intolerable obscenity
which afflicted him with shame  it would have been better  or so he
thought at that moment  for the whole universe never to have existed
than for this one thing to have happened  then he decided  in spite of
his theoretical belief that it was an organism too low for much pain 
that it had better be killed  he had neither boots nor stone nor stick 
the frog proved remarkably hard to kill  when it was far too late to
desist he saw clearly that he had been a fool to make the attempt 
whatever its sufferings might be he had certainly increased and not
diminished them  but he had to go through with it  the job seemed to
take nearly an hour  and when at last the mangled result was quite still
and he went down to the waters edge to wash  he was sick and shaken  it
seems odd to say this of a man who had been on the somme  but the
architects tell us that nothing is great or small save by position 

at last he got up and resumed his walk  next moment he started and
looked at the ground again  he quickened his pace  and then once more
stopped and looked  he stood stock-still and covered his face  he called
aloud upon heaven to break the nightmare or to let him understand what
was happening  a trail of mutilated frogs lay along the edge of the
island  picking his footsteps with care  he followed it  he counted ten 
fifteen  twenty  and the twenty-first brought him to a place where the
wood came down to the waters edge  he went into the wood and came out
on the other side  there he stopped dead and stared  weston  still
clothed but without his pith helmet  was standing about thirty feet
away  and as ransom watched he was tearing a frog—quietly and almost
surgically inserting his forefinger  with its long sharp nail  under the
skin behind the creatures head and ripping it open  ransom had not
noticed before that weston had such remarkable nails  then he finished
the operation  threw the bleeding ruin away  and looked up  their eyes
met 

if ransom said nothing  it was because he could not speak  he saw a man
who was certainly not ill  to judge from his easy stance and the
powerful use he had just been making of his fingers  he saw a man who
was certainly weston  to judge from his height and build and colouring
and features  in that sense he was quite recognisable  but the terror
was that he was also unrecognisable  he did not look like a sick man 
but he looked very like a dead one  the face which he raised from
torturing the frog had that terrible power which the face of a corpse
sometimes has of simply rebuffing every conceivable human attitude one
can adopt towards it  the expressionless mouth  the unwinking stare of
the eyes  something heavy and inorganic in the very folds of the cheek 
said clearly  “i have features as you have  but there is nothing in
common between you and me ” it was this that kept ransom speechless 
what could you say—what appeal or threat could have any meaning—to
 that   and now  forcing its way up into consciousness  thrusting aside
every mental habit and every longing not to believe  came the conviction
that this  in fact  was not a man  that westons body was kept  walking
and undecaying  in perelandra by some wholly different kind of life  and
that weston himself was gone 

it looked at ransom in silence and at last began to smile  we have all
often spoken—ransom himself had often spoken—of a devilish smile  now he
realised that he had never taken the words seriously  the smile was not
bitter  nor raging  nor  in an ordinary sense  sinister  it was not even
mocking  it seemed to summon ransom  with a horrible naïveté of welcome 
into the world of its own pleasures  as if all men were at one in those
pleasures  as if they were the most natural thing in the world and no
dispute could ever have occurred about them  it was not furtive  nor
ashamed  it had nothing of the conspirator in it  it did not defy
goodness  it ignored it to the point of annihilation  ransom perceived
that he had never before seen anything but half-hearted and uneasy
attempts at evil  this creature was whole-hearted  the extremity of its
evil had passed beyond all struggle into some state which bore a
horrible similarity to innocence  it was beyond vice as the lady was
beyond virtue 

the stillness and the smiling lasted for perhaps two whole minutes 
certainly not less  then ransom made to take a step towards the thing 
with no very clear notion of what he would do when he reached it  he
stumbled and fell  he had a curious difficulty in getting to his feet
again  and when he got to them he overbalanced and fell for the second
time  then there was a moment of darkness filled with a noise of roaring
express trains  after that the golden sky and coloured waves returned
and he knew he was alone and recovering from a faint  as he lay there 
still unable and perhaps unwilling to rise  it came into his mind that
in certain old philosophers and poets he had read that the mere sight of
the devils was one of the greatest among the torments of hell  it had
seemed to him till now merely a quaint fancy  and yet  as he now saw 
even the children know better  no child would have any difficulty in
understanding that there might be a face the mere beholding of which was
final calamity  the children  the poets  and the philosophers were
right  as there is one face above all worlds merely to see which is
irrevocable joy  so at the bottom of all worlds that face is waiting
whose sight alone is the misery from which none who beholds it can
recover  and though there seemed to be  and indeed were  a thousand
roads by which a man could walk through the world  there was not a
single one which did not lead sooner or later either to the beatific or
the miserific vision  he himself had  of course  seen only a mask or
faint adumbration of it  even so  he was not quite sure that he would
live 

when he was able  he got up and set out to search for the thing  he must
either try to prevent it from meeting the lady or at least be present
when they met  what he could do  he did not know  but it was clear
beyond all evasion that this was what he had been sent for  westons
body  travelling in a space-ship  had been the bridge by which something
else had invaded perelandra—whether that supreme and original evil whom
in mars they call the bent one  or one of his lesser followers  made no
difference  ransom was all goose-flesh  and his knees kept getting in
each others way  it surprised him that he could experience so extreme a
terror and yet be walking and thinking—as men in war or sickness are
surprised to find how much can be borne  “it will drive us mad ” “it
will kill us outright ” we say  and then it happens and we find
ourselves neither mad nor dead  still held to the task 

the weather changed  the plain on which he was walking swelled to a wave
of land  the sky grew paler  it was soon rather primrose than gold  the
sea grew darker  almost the colour of bronze  soon the island was
climbing considerable hills of water  once or twice he had to sit down
and rest  after several hours  for his progress was very slow  he
suddenly saw two human figures on what was for the moment a skyline 
next moment they were out of sight as the country heaved up between them
and him  it took about half an hour to reach them  westons body was
standing—swaying and balancing itself to meet each change of the ground
in a manner of which the real weston would have been incapable  it was
talking to the lady  and what surprised ransom most was that she
continued to listen to it without turning to welcome him or even to
comment on his arrival when he came and sat down beside her on the soft
turf 

“it  is  a great branching out ” it was saying  “this making of story or
poetry about things that might be but are not  if you shrink back from
it  are you not drawing back from the fruit that is offered you ”

“it is not from the making a story that i shrink back  o stranger ” she
answered  “but from this one story that you have put into my head  i can
make myself stories about my children or the king  i can make it that
the fish fly and the land beasts swim  but if i try to make the story
about living on the fixed island i do not know how to make it about
maleldil  for if i make it that he has changed his command  that will
not go  and if i make it that we are living there against his command 
that is like making the sky all black and the water so that we cannot
drink it and the air so that we cannot breathe it  but also  i do not
see what is the pleasure of trying to make these things ”

“to make you wiser  older ” said westons body 

“do you know for certain that it will do that ” she asked 

“yes  for certain ” it replied  “that is how the women of my world have
become so great and so beautiful ”

“do not listen to him ” broke in ransom  “send him away  do not hear
what he says  do not think of it ”

she turned to ransom for the first time  there had been some very slight
change in her face since he had last seen her  it was not sad  nor
deeply bewildered  but the hint of something precarious had increased 
on the other hand she was clearly pleased to see him  though surprised
at his interruption  and her first words revealed that her failure to
greet him at his arrival had resulted from her never having envisaged
the possibility of a conversation between more than two speakers  and
throughout the rest of their talk  her ignorance of the technique of
general conversation gave a curious and disquieting quality to the whole
scene  she had no notion of how to glance rapidly from one face to
another or to disentangle two remarks at once  sometimes she listened
wholly to ransom  sometimes wholly to the other  but never to both 

“why do you start speaking before this man has finished  piebald ” she
inquired  “how do they do in your world where you are many and more than
two must often be together  do they not talk in turns  or have you an
art to understand even when all speak together  i am not old enough for
that ”

“i do not want you to hear him at all ” said ransom  “he is——” and then
he hesitated  “bad ” “liar ” “enemy ” none of these words would  as yet 
have any meaning for her  racking his brains he thought of their
previous conversation about the great eldil who had held on to the old
good and refused the new one  yes  that would be her only approach to
the idea of badness  he was just about to speak but it was too late 
westons voice anticipated him 

“this piebald ” it said  “does not want you to hear me  because he wants
to keep you young  he does not want you to go on to the new fruits that
you have never tasted before ”

“but how could he want to keep me younger ”

“have you not seen already ” said westons body  “that piebald is one
who always shrinks back from the wave that is coming towards us and
would like  if he could  to bring back the wave that is past  in the
very first hour of his talking with you  did he not betray this  he did
not know that all was new since maleldil became a man and that now all
creatures with reason will be men  you had to teach him this  and when
he had learned it he did not welcome it  he was sorry that there would
be no more of the old furry people  he would bring back that old world
if he could  and when you asked him to teach you death  he would not  he
wanted you to remain young  not to learn death  was it not he who first
put into your mind the very thought that it was possible not to desire
the wave that maleldil was rolling towards us  to shrink so much that
you would cut off your arms and legs to prevent it coming ”

“you mean he is so young ”

“he is what in my world we call bad ” said westons body  “one who
rejects the fruit he is given for the sake of the fruit he expected or
the fruit he found last time ”

“we must make him older  then ” said the lady  and though she did not
look at ransom  all the queen and mother in her were revealed to him and
he knew that she wished him  and all things  infinitely well  and he—he
could do nothing  his weapon had been knocked out of his hand 

“and will you teach us death ” said the lady to westons shape  where it
stood above her 

“yes ” it said  “it is for this that i came here  that you may have
death in abundance  but you must be very courageous ”

“ courageous   what is that ”

“it is what makes you to swim on a day when the waves are so great and
swift that something inside you bids you to stay on land ”

“i know  and those are the best days of all for swimming ”

“yes  but to find death  and with death the real oldness and the strong
beauty and the uttermost branching out  you must plunge into things
greater than waves ”

“go on  your words are like no other words that i have ever heard  they
are like the bubble breaking on the tree  they make me think of—of—i do
not know what they make me think of ”

“i will speak greater words than these  but i must wait till you are
older ”

“make me older ”

“lady  lady ” broke in ransom  “will not maleldil make you older in his
own time and his own way  and will not that be far better ”

westons face did not turn in his direction either at this point or at
any other time during the conversation  but his voice  addressed wholly
to the lady  answered ransoms interruption 

“you see ” it said  “he himself  though he did not mean nor wish to do
so  made you see a few days ago that maleldil is beginning to teach you
to walk by yourself  without holding you by the hand  that was the first
branching out  when you came to know that  you were becoming really old 
and since then maleldil has let you learn much—not from his own voice 
but from mine  you are becoming your own  that is what maleldil wants
you to do  that is why he has let you be separated from the king and
even  in a way  from himself  his way of making you older is to make you
make yourself older  and yet this piebald would have you sit still and
wait for maleldil to do it all ”

“what must we do to piebald to make him older ” said the lady 

“i do not think you can help him till you are older yourself ” said the
voice of weston  “you cannot help anyone yet  you are as a tree without
fruit ”

“it is very true ” said the lady  “go on ”

“then listen ” said westons body  “have you understood that to wait for
maleldils voice when maleldil wishes you to walk on your own is a kind
of disobedience ”

“i think i have ”

“the wrong kind of obeying itself can be a disobeying ”

the lady thought for a few moments and then clapped her hands  “i see ”
she said  “i see  oh  how old you make me  before now i have chased a
beast for mirth  and it has understood and run away from me  if it had
stood still and let me catch it  that would have been a sort of
obeying—but not the best sort ”

“you understand very well  when you are fully grown you will be even
wiser and more beautiful than the women of my own world  and you see
that it might be so with maleldils biddings ”

“i think i do not see quite clearly ”

“are you certain that he really wishes to be always obeyed ”

“how can we not obey what we love ”

“the beast that ran away loved you ”

“i wonder ” said the lady  “if that is the same  the beast knows very
well when i mean it to run away and when i want it to come to me  but
maleldil has never said to us that any word or work of his was a jest 
how could our beloved need to jest or frolic as we do  he is all a
burning joy and a strength  it is like thinking that he needed sleep or
food ”

“no  it would not be a jest  that is only a thing like it  not the thing
itself  but could the taking away of your hand from his—the full growing
up—the walking in your own way—could that ever be perfect unless you
had  if only once   seemed  to disobey him ”

“how could one  seem  to disobey ”

“by doing what he only  seemed  to forbid  there might be a commanding
which he wished you to break ”

“but if he told us we were to break it  then it would be no command  and
if he did not  how should we know ”

“how wise you are growing  beautiful one ” said westons mouth  “no  if
he told you to break what he commanded  it would be no true command  as
you have seen  for you are right  he makes no jests  a real disobeying 
a real branching out  this is what he secretly longs for  secretly 
because to tell you would spoil all ”

“i begin to wonder ” said the lady after a pause  “whether you are so
much older than i  surely what you are saying is like fruit with no
taste  how can i step out of his will save into something that cannot be
wished  shall i start trying not to love him—or the king—or the beasts 
it would be like trying to walk on water or swim through islands  shall
i try not to sleep or to drink or to laugh  i thought your words had a
meaning  but now it seems they have none  to walk out of his will is to
walk into nowhere ”

“that is true of all his commands except one ”

“but can that one be different ”

“nay  you see of yourself that it is different  these other commands of
his—to love  to sleep  to fill this world with your children—you see for
yourself that they are good  and they are the same in all worlds  but
the command against living on the fixed island is not so  you have
already learned that he gave no such command to my world  and you cannot
see where the goodness of it is  no wonder  if it were really good  must
he not have commanded it to all worlds alike  for how could maleldil not
command what was good  there is  no  good in it  maleldil himself is
showing you that  this moment  through your own reason  it is mere
command  it is forbidding for the mere sake of forbidding ”

“but why        ”

“in order that you may break it  what other reason can there be  it is
not good  it is not the same for other worlds  it stands between you and
all settled life  all command of your own days  is not maleldil showing
you as plainly as he can that it was set up as a test—as a great wave
you have to go over  that you may become really old  really separate
from him ”

“but if this concerns me so deeply  why does he put none of this into my
mind  it is all coming from you  stranger  there is no whisper  even  of
the voice saying yes to your words ”

“but do you not see that there cannot be  he longs—oh  how greatly he
longs—to see his creature become fully itself  to stand up in its own
reason and its own courage even against him  but how can he  tell  it to
do this  that would spoil all  whatever it did after that would only be
one more step taken  with  him  this is the one thing of all the things
he desires in which he must have no finger  do you think he is not weary
of seeing nothing but himself in all that he has made  if that contented
him  why should he create at all  to find the other—the thing whose will
is no longer his—that is maleldils desire ”

“if i could but know this——”

“he must not tell you  he cannot tell you  the nearest he can come to
telling you is to let some other creature tell it for him  and behold 
he has done so  is it for nothing  or without his will  that i have
journeyed through deep heaven to teach you what he would have you know
but must not teach you himself ”

“lady ” said ransom  “if i speak  will you hear me ”

“gladly  piebald ”

“this man has said that the law against living on the fixed island is
different from the other laws  because it is not the same for all worlds
and because we cannot see the goodness in it  and so far he says well 
but then he says that it is thus different in order that you may disobey
it  but there might be another reason ”

“say it  piebald ”

“i think he made one law of that kind in order that there might be
obedience  in all these other matters what you call obeying him is but
doing what seems good in your own eyes also  is love content with that 
you do them  indeed  because they are his will  but not only because
they are his will  where can you taste the joy of obeying unless he bids
you do something for which his bidding is the  only  reason  when we
spoke last you said that if you told the beasts to walk on their heads 
they would delight to do so  so i know that you understand well what i
am saying ”

“oh  brave piebald ” said the green lady  “this is the best you have
said yet  this makes me older far  yet it does not feel like the oldness
this other is giving me  oh  how well i see it  we cannot walk out of
maleldils will  but he has given us a way to walk out of  our  will 
and there could be no such way except a command like this  out of our
own will  it is like passing out through the worlds roof into deep
heaven  all beyond is love himself  i knew there was joy in looking upon
the fixed island and laying down all thought of ever living there  but i
did not till now understand ” her face was radiant as she spoke  but
then a shade of bewilderment crossed it  “piebald ” she said  “if you
are so young  as this other says  how do you know these things ”

“he says i am young  but i say not ”

the voice of westons face spoke suddenly  and it was louder and deeper
than before and less like westons voice 

“i am older than he ” it said  “and he dare not deny it  before the
mothers of the mothers of his mother were conceived  i was already older
than he could reckon  i have been with maleldil in deep heaven where he
never came and heard the eternal councils  and in the order of creation
i am greater than he  and before me he is of no account  is it not so ”
the corpse-like face did not even now turn towards him  but the speaker
and the lady both seemed to wait for ransom to reply  the falsehood
which sprang to his mind died on his lips  in that air  even when truth
seemed fatal  only truth would serve  licking his lips and choking down
a feeling of nausea  he answered 

“in our world to be older is not always to be wiser ”

“look on him ” said westons body to the lady  “consider how white his
cheeks have turned and how his forehead is wet  you have not seen such
things before  you will see them more often hereafter  it is what
happens—it is the beginning of what happens—to little creatures when
they set themselves against great ones ”

an exquisite thrill of fear travelled along ransoms spine  what saved
him was the face of the lady  untouched by the evil so close to her 
removed as it were ten years journey deep within the region of her own
innocence  and by that innocence at once so protected and so endangered 
she looked up at the standing death above her  puzzled indeed  but not
beyond the bounds of cheerful curiosity  and said 

“but he was right  stranger  about this forbidding  it is you who need
to be made older  can you not see ”

“i have always seen the whole whereof he sees but the half  it is most
true that maleldil has given you a way of walking out of your own
will—but out of your deepest will ”

“and what is that ”

“your deepest will  at present  is to obey him—to be always as you are
now  only his beast or his very young child  the way out of that is
hard  it was made hard that only the very great  the very wise  the very
courageous should dare to walk in it  to go on—on out of this smallness
in which you now live—through the dark wave of his forbidding  into the
real life  deep life  with all its joy and splendour and hardness ”

“listen  lady ” said ransom  “there is something he is not telling you 
all this that we are now talking has been talked before  the thing he
wants you to try has been tried before  long ago  when our world began 
there was only one man and one woman in it  as you and the king are in
this  and there once before he stood  as he stands now  talking to the
woman  he had found her alone as he has found you alone  and she
listened  and did the thing maleldil had forbidden her to do  but no joy
and splendour came of it  what came of it i cannot tell you because you
have no image of it in your mind  but all love was troubled and made
cold  and maleldils voice became hard to hear so that wisdom grew
little among them  and the woman was against the man and the mother
against the child  and when they looked to eat there was no fruit on
their trees  and hunting for food took all their time  so that their
life became narrower  not wider ”

“he has hidden the half of what happened ” said westons corpse-like
mouth  “hardness came out of it but also splendour  they made with their
own hands mountains higher than your fixed island  they made for
themselves floating islands greater than yours which they could move at
will through the ocean faster than any bird can fly  because there was
not always food enough  a woman could give the only fruit to her child
or her husband and eat death instead—could give them all  as you in your
little narrow life of playing and kissing and riding fishes have never
done  nor shall do till you break the commandment  because knowledge was
harder to find  those few who found it became more beautiful and
excelled their fellows as you excel the beasts  and thousands were
striving for their love      ”

“i think i will go to sleep now ” said the lady quite suddenly  up to
this point she had been listening to westons body with open mouth and
wide eyes  but as he spoke of the women with the thousands of lovers she
yawned  with the unconcealed and unpremeditated yawn of a young cat 

“not yet ” said the other  “there is more  he has not told you that it
was this breaking of the commandment which brought maleldil to our world
and because of which he was made man  he dare not deny it ”

“do you say this  piebald ” asked the lady 

ransom was sitting with his fingers locked so tightly that his knuckles
were white  the unfairness of it all was wounding him like barbed wire 
unfair       unfair  how could maleldil expect him to fight against
this  to fight with every weapon taken from him  forbidden to lie and
yet brought to places where truth seemed fatal  it was unfair  a sudden
impulse of hot rebellion arose in him  a second later  doubt  like a
huge wave  came breaking over him  how if the enemy were right after
all   felix peccatum adae   even the church would tell him that good
came of disobedience in the end  yes  and it was true too that he 
ransom  was a timid creature  a man who shrank back from new and hard
things  on which side  after all  did the temptation lie  progress
passed before his eyes in a great momentary vision  cities  armies  tall
ships  and libraries and fame  and the grandeur of poetry spurting like
a fountain out of the labours and ambitions of men  who could be certain
that creative evolution was not the deepest truth  from all sorts of
secret crannies in his own mind whose very existence he had never before
suspected  something wild and heady and delicious began to rise  to pour
itself toward the shape of weston  “it is a spirit  it is a spirit ”
said this inner voice  “and you are only a man  it goes on from century
to century  you are only a man       ”

“do you say this  piebald ” asked the lady a second time 

the spell was broken 

“i will tell you what i say ” answered ransom  jumping to his feet  “of
course good came of it  is maleldil a beast that we can stop his path 
or a leaf that we can twist his shape  whatever you do  he will make
good of it  but not the good he had prepared for you if you had obeyed
him  that is lost for ever  the first king and first mother of our world
did the forbidden thing  and he brought good of it in the end  but what
they did was not good  and what they lost we have not seen  and there
were some to whom no good came nor ever will come ” he turned to the
body of weston  “you ” he said  “tell her all  what good came to you  do
 you  rejoice that maleldil became a man  tell her of  your  joys  and
of what profit you had when you made maleldil and death acquainted ”

in the moment that followed this speech two things happened that were
utterly unlike terrestrial experience  the body that had been westons
threw up its head and opened its mouth and gave a long melancholy howl
like a dog  and the lady lay down  wholly unconcerned  and closed her
eyes and was instantly asleep  and while these two things were happening
the piece of ground on which the two men stood and the woman lay was
rushing down a great hillside of water 

ransom kept his eyes fixed upon the enemy  but it took no notice of him 
its eyes moved like the eyes of a living man but it was hard to be sure
what it was looking at  or whether it really used the eyes as organs of
vision at all  one got the impression of a force that cleverly kept the
pupils of those eyes fixed in a suitable direction while the mouth
talked but which  for its own purpose  used wholly different modes of
perception  the thing sat down close to the ladys head on the far side
of her from ransom  if you could call it sitting down  the body did not
reach its squatting position by the normal movements of a man  it was
more as if some external force manœuvred it into the right position and
then let it drop  it was impossible to point to any particular motion
which was definitely non-human  ransom had the sense of watching an
imitation of living motions which had been very well studied and was
technically correct  but somehow it lacked the master touch  and he was
chilled with an inarticulate  night-nursery horror of the thing he had
to deal with—the managed corpse  the bogey  the un-man 

there was nothing to do but to watch  to sit there  for ever if need be 
guarding the lady from the un-man while their island climbed
interminably over the alps and andes of burnished water  all three were
very still  beasts and birds came often and looked upon them  hours
later the un-man began to speak  it did not even look in ransoms
direction  slowly and cumbrously  as if by some machinery that needed
oiling  it made its mouth and lips pronounce his name 

“ransom ” it said 

“well ” said ransom 

“nothing ” said the un-man  he shot an inquisitive glance at it  was the
creature mad  but it looked  as before  dead rather than mad  sitting
there with the head bowed and the mouth a little open  and some yellow
dust from the moss settled in the creases of its cheeks  and the legs
crossed tailor-wise  and the hands  with their long metallic-looking
nails  pressed flat together on the ground before it  he dismissed the
problem from his mind and returned to his own uncomfortable thoughts 

“ransom ” it said again 

“what is it ” said ransom sharply 

“nothing ” it answered 

again there was silence  and again  about a minute later  the horrible
mouth said 

“ransom ” this time he made no reply  another minute and it uttered his
name again  and then  like a minute gun  “ransom       ransom      
ransom ” perhaps a hundred times 

“what the hell do you want ” he roared at last 

“nothing ” said the voice  next time he determined not to answer  but
when it had called on him about a thousand times he found himself
answering whether he would or no  and “nothing ” came the reply  he
taught himself to keep silent in the end  not that the torture of
resisting his impulse to speak was less than the torture of response but
because something within him rose up to combat the tormentors assurance
that he must yield in the end  if the attack had been of some more
violent kind it might have been easier to resist  what chilled and
almost cowed him was the union of malice with something nearly childish 
for temptation  for blasphemy  for a whole battery of horrors  he was in
some sort prepared  but hardly for this petty  indefatigable nagging as
of a nasty little boy at a preparatory school  indeed no imagined horror
could have surpassed the sense which grew within him as the slow hours
passed  that this creature was  by all human standards  inside out—its
heart on the surface and its shallowness at the heart  on the surface 
great designs and an antagonism to heaven which involved the fate of
worlds  but deep within  when every veil had been pierced  was there 
after all  nothing but a black puerility  an aimless empty spitefulness
content to sate itself with the tiniest cruelties  as love does not
disdain the smallest kindness  what kept him steady  long after all
possibility of thinking about something else had disappeared  was the
decision that if he must hear either the word ransom or the word nothing
a million times  he would prefer the word ransom 

and all the time the little jewel-coloured land went soaring up into the
yellow firmament and hung there a moment and tilted its woods and went
racing down into the warm lustrous depths between the waves  and the
lady lay sleeping with one arm bent beneath her head and her lips a
little parted  sleeping  assuredly—for her eyes were shut and her
breathing regular—yet not looking quite like those who sleep in our
world  for her face was full of expression and intelligence  and the
limbs looked as if they were ready at any moment to leap up  and
altogether she gave the impression that sleep was not a thing that
happened to her but an action which she performed 

then all at once it was night  “ransom       ransom       ransom      
ransom” went on the voice  and suddenly it crossed his mind that though
he would some time require sleep  the un-man might not 




                                  ten


sleep proved to be indeed the problem  for what seemed a great time 
cramped and wearied  and soon hungry and thirsty as well  he sat still
in the darkness trying not to attend to the unflagging repetition of
“ransom—ransom—ransom ” but presently he found himself listening to a
conversation of which he knew he had not heard the beginning and
realised that he had slept  the lady seemed to be saying very little 
westons voice was speaking gently and continuously  it was not talking
about the fixed land nor even about maleldil  it appeared to be telling 
with extreme beauty and pathos  a number of stories  and at first ransom
could not perceive any connecting link between them  they were all about
women  but women who had apparently lived at different periods of the
worlds history and in quite different circumstances  from the ladys
replies it appeared that the stories contained much that she did not
understand  but oddly enough the un-man did not mind  if the questions
aroused by any one story proved at all difficult to answer  the speaker
simply dropped that story and instantly began another  the heroines of
the stories seemed all to have suffered a great deal—they had been
oppressed by fathers  cast off by husbands  deserted by lovers  their
children had risen up against them and society had driven them out  but
the stories all ended  in a sense  happily  sometimes with honours and
praises to a heroine still living  more often with tardy acknowledgment
and unavailing tears after her death  as the endless speech proceeded 
the ladys questions grew always fewer  some meaning for the words death
and sorrow—though what kind of meaning ransom could not even guess—was
apparently being created in her mind by mere repetition  at last it
dawned upon him what all these stories were about  each one of these
women had stood forth alone and braved a terrible risk for her child 
her lover  or her people  each had been misunderstood  reviled  and
persecuted  but each also magnificently vindicated by the event  the
precise details were often not very easy to follow  ransom had more than
a suspicion that many of these noble pioneers had been what in ordinary
terrestrial speech we call witches or perverts  but that was all in the
background  what emerged from the stories was rather an image than an
idea—the picture of the tall  slender form  unbowed though the worlds
weight rested upon its shoulders  stepping forth fearless and friendless
into the dark to do for others what those others forbade it to do yet
needed to have done  and all the time  as a sort of background to these
goddess shapes  the speaker was building up a picture of the other sex 
no word was directly spoken on the subject  but one felt them there as a
huge  dim multitude of creatures pitifully childish and complacently
arrogant  timid  meticulous  unoriginating  sluggish and ox-like  rooted
to the earth almost in their indolence  prepared to try nothing  to risk
nothing  to make no exertion  and capable of being raised into full life
only by the unthanked and rebellious virtue of their females  it was
very well done  ransom  who had little of the pride of sex  found
himself for a few moments all but believing it 

in the midst of this the darkness was suddenly torn by a flash of
lightning  a few seconds later came a revel of perelandrian thunder 
like the playing of a heavenly tambourine  and after that warm rain 
ransom did not much regard it  the flash had shown him the un-man
sitting bolt upright  the lady raised on one elbow  the dragon lying
awake at her head  a grove of trees beyond  and great waves against the
horizon  he was thinking of what he had seen  he was wondering how the
lady could see that face—those jaws monotonously moving as if they were
rather munching than talking—and not know the creature to be evil  he
saw  of course  that this was unreasonable of him  he himself was
doubtless an uncouth figure in her eyes  she could have no knowledge
either about evil or about the normal appearance of terrestrial man to
guide her  the expression on her face  revealed in the sudden light  was
one that he had not seen there before  her eyes were not fixed on the
narrator  as far as that went  her thoughts might have been a thousand
miles away  her lips were shut and a little pursed  her eyebrows were
slightly raised  he had not yet seen her look so like a woman of our own
race  and yet her expression was one he had not very often met on
earth—except  as he realised with a shock  on the stage  “like a tragedy
queen” was the disgusting comparison that arose in his mind  of course
it was a gross exaggeration  it was an insult for which he could not
forgive himself  and yet       and yet       the tableau revealed by the
lightning had photographed itself on his brain  do what he would  he
found it impossible not to think of that new look in her face  a very
 good  tragedy queen  no doubt  the heroine of a very great tragedy 
very nobly played by an actress who was a good woman in real life  by
earthly standards  an expression to be praised  even to be revered  but
remembering all that he had read in her countenance before  the
unselfconscious radiance  the frolic sanctity  the depth of stillness
that reminded him sometimes of infancy and sometimes of extreme old age
while the hard youth and valiancy of face and body denied both  he found
this new expression horrifying  the fatal touch of invited grandeur  of
enjoyed pathos—the assumption  however slight  of a rôle—seemed a
hateful vulgarity  perhaps she was doing no more—he had good hope that
she was doing no more—than responding in a purely imaginative fashion to
this new art of story or poetry  but by god shed better not  and for
the first time the thought “this cant go on” formulated itself in his
mind 

“i will go where the leaves cover us from the rain ” said her voice in
the darkness  ransom had hardly noticed that he was getting wet—in a
world without clothes it is less important  but he rose when he heard
her move and followed her as well as he could by ear  the un-man seemed
to be doing the same  they progressed in total darkness on a surface as
variable as that of water  every now and then there was another flash 
one saw the lady walking erect  the un-man slouching by her side with
westons shirt and shorts now sodden and clinging to it  and the dragon
puffing and waddling behind  at last they came to a place where the
carpet under their feet was dry and there was a drumming noise of rain
on firm leaves above their heads  they lay down again  “and another
time ” began the un-man at once  “there was a queen in our world who
ruled over a little land——”

“hush ” said the lady  “let us listen to the rain ” then  after a
moment  she added  “what was that  it was some beast i never heard
before”—and indeed  there had been something very like a low growl close
beside them 

“i do not know ” said the voice of weston 

“i think i do ” said ransom 

“hush ” said the lady again  and no more was said that night 

this was the beginning of a series of days and nights which ransom
remembered with loathing for the rest of his life  he had been only too
correct in supposing that his enemy required no sleep  fortunately the
lady did  but she needed a good deal less than ransom and possibly  as
the days passed  came to take less than she needed  it seemed to ransom
that whenever he dozed he awoke to find the un-man already in
conversation with her  he was dead tired  he could hardly have endured
it at all but for the fact that their hostess quite frequently dismissed
them both from her presence  on such occasions ransom kept close to the
un-man  it was a rest from the main battle  but it was a very imperfect
rest  he did not dare to let the enemy out of his sight for a moment 
and every day its society became more unendurable  he had full
opportunity to learn the falsity of the maxim that the prince of
darkness is a gentleman  again and again he felt that a suave and subtle
mephistopheles with red cloak and rapier and a feather in his cap  or
even a sombre tragic satan out of  paradise lost   would have been a
welcome release from the thing he was actually doomed to watch  it was
not like dealing with a wicked politician at all  it was much more like
being set to guard an imbecile or a monkey or a very nasty child  what
had staggered and disgusted him when it first began saying  “ransom
      ransom      ” continued to disgust him every day and every hour  it
showed plenty of subtlety and intelligence when talking to the lady  but
ransom soon perceived that it regarded intelligence simply and solely as
a weapon  which it had no more wish to employ in its off-duty hours than
a soldier has to do bayonet practice when he is on leave  thought was
for it a device necessary to certain ends  but thought in itself did not
interest it  it assumed reason as externally and inorganically as it had
assumed westons body  the moment the lady was out of sight it seemed to
relapse  a great deal of his time was spent in protecting the animals
from it  whenever it got out of sight  or even a few yards ahead  it
would make a grab at any beast or bird within its reach and pull out
some fur or feathers  ransom tried whenever possible to get between it
and its victim  on such occasions there were nasty moments when the two
stood facing each other  it never came to a fight  for the un-man merely
grinned and perhaps spat and fell back a little  but before that
happened ransom usually had opportunity to discover how terribly he
feared it  for side by side with his disgust  the more childlike terror
of living with a ghost or a mechanised corpse never left him for many
minutes together  the fact of being  alone  with it sometimes rushed
upon his mind with such dismay that it took all his reason to resist his
longing for society—his impulse to rush madly over the island until he
found the lady and to beg her protection  when the un-man could not get
animals it was content with plants  it was fond of cutting their outer
rinds through with its nails  or grubbing up roots  or pulling off
leaves  or even tearing up handfuls of turf  with ransom himself it had
innumerable games to play  it had a whole repertory of obscenities to
perform with its own—or rather with westons—body  and the mere
silliness of them was almost worse than the dirtiness  it would sit
making grimaces at him for hours together  and then  for hours more  it
would go back to its old repetition of “ransom       ransom ” often its
grimaces achieved a horrible resemblance to people whom ransom had known
and loved in our own world  but worst of all were those moments when it
allowed weston to come back into its countenance  then its voice  which
was always westons voice  would begin a pitiful  hesitant mumbling 
“you be very careful  ransom  im down in the bottom of a big black
hole  no im not  though  im on perelandra  i cant think very well
now  but that doesnt matter  he does all my thinking for me  itll get
quite easy presently  that boy keeps on shutting the windows  thats all
right  theyve taken off my head and put someone elses on me  ill soon
be all right now  they wont let me see my press cuttings  so then i
went and told him that if they didnt want me in the first fifteen they
could jolly well do without me  see  well tell that young whelp its an
insult to the examiners to show up this kind of work  what i want to
know is why i should pay for a first-class ticket and then be crowded
out like this  its not fair  not fair  i never meant any harm  could
you take some of this weight off my chest  i dont want all those
clothes  let me alone  let me alone  its not fair  its not fair  what
enormous bluebottles  they say you get used to them”—and then it would
end in the canine howl  ransom never could make up his mind whether it
was a trick or whether a decaying psychic energy that had once been
weston were indeed fitfully and miserably alive within the body that sat
there beside him  he discovered that any hatred he had once felt for the
professor was dead  he found it natural to pray fervently for his soul 
yet what he felt for weston was not exactly pity  up till that moment 
whenever he had thought of hell  he had pictured the lost souls as being
still human  now  as the frightful abyss which parts ghosthood from
manhood yawned before him  pity was almost swallowed up in horror—in the
unconquerable revulsion of the life within him from positive and
self-consuming death  if the remains of weston were  at such moments 
speaking through the lips of the un-man  then weston was not now a man
at all  the forces which had begun  perhaps years ago  to eat away his
humanity had now completed their work  the intoxicated will which had
been slowly poisoning the intelligence and the affections had now at
last poisoned itself and the whole psychic organism had fallen to
pieces  only a ghost was left—an everlasting unrest  a crumbling  a
ruin  an odour of decay  “and this ” thought ransom  “might be my
destination  or hers ”

but of course the hours spent alone with the un-man were like hours in a
back area  the real business of life was the interminable conversation
between the tempter and the green lady  taken hour by hour the progress
was hard to estimate  but as the days passed ransom could not resist the
conviction that the general development was in the enemys favour  there
were  of course  ups and downs  often the un-man was unexpectedly
repulsed by some simplicity which it seemed not to have anticipated 
often  too  ransoms own contributions to the terrible debate were for
the moment successful  there were times when he thought  “thank god 
weve won at last ” but the enemy was never tired  and ransom grew more
weary all the time  and presently he thought he could see signs that the
lady was becoming tired too  in the end he taxed her with it and begged
her to send them both away  but she rebuked him  and her rebuke revealed
how dangerous the situation had already become  “shall i go and rest and
play ” she asked  “while all this lies on our hands  not till i am
certain that there is no great deed to be done by me for the king and
for the children of our children ”

it was on those lines that the enemy now worked almost exclusively 
though the lady had no word for duty he had made it appear to her in the
light of a duty that she should continue to fondle the idea of
disobedience  and convinced her that it would be a cowardice if she
repulsed him  the ideas of the great deed  of the great risk  of a kind
of martyrdom  were presented to her every day  varied in a thousand
forms  the notion of waiting to ask the king before a decision was made
had been unobtrusively shuffled aside  any such “cowardice” was now not
to be thought of  the whole point of her action—the whole grandeur—would
lie in taking it without the kings knowledge  in leaving him utterly
free to repudiate it  so that all the benefits should be his  and all
the risks hers  and with the risk  of course  all the magnanimity  the
pathos  the tragedy  and the originality  and also  the tempter hinted 
it would be no use asking the king  for he would certainly  not  approve
the action  men were like that  the king must be forced to be free  now 
while she was on her own—now or never—the noble thing must be achieved 
and with that “now or never” he began to play on a fear which the lady
apparently shared with the women of earth—the fear that life might be
wasted  some great opportunity let slip  “how if i were as a tree that
could have born gourds and yet bore none ” she said  ransom tried to
convince her that children were fruit enough  but the un-man asked
whether this elaborate division of the human race into two sexes could
possibly be meant for no other purpose than offspring —a matter which
might have been more simply provided for  as it was in many of the
plants  a moment later it was explaining that men like ransom in his own
world—men of that intensely male and backward-looking type who always
shrank away from the new good—had continuously laboured to keep woman
down to mere child-bearing and to ignore the high destiny for which
maleldil had actually created her  it told her that such men had already
done incalculable harm  let her look to it that nothing of the sort
happened on perelandra  it was at this stage that it began to teach her
many new words  words like creative and intuition and spiritual  but
that was one of its false steps  when she had at last been made to
understand what “creative” meant she forgot all about the great risk and
the tragic loneliness and laughed for a whole minute on end  finally she
told the un-man that it was younger even than piebald  and sent them
both away 

ransom gained ground over that  but on the following day he lost it all
by losing his temper  the enemy had been pressing on her with more than
usual ardour the nobility of self-sacrifice and self-dedication  and the
enchantment seemed to be deepening in her mind every moment  when
ransom  goaded beyond all patience  had leaped to his feet and really
turned upon her  talking far too quickly and almost shouting  and even
forgetting his old solar and intermixing english words  he tried to tell
her that hed seen this kind of “unselfishness” in action  to tell her
of women making themselves sick with hunger rather than begin the meal
before the man of the house returned  though they knew perfectly well
that there was nothing he disliked more  of mothers wearing themselves
to a ravelling to marry some daughter to a man whom she detested  of
agrippina and of lady macbeth  “can you not see ” he shouted  “that he
is making you say words that mean nothing  what is the good of saying
you would do this for the kings sake when you know it is what the king
would hate most  are you maleldil that you should determine what is good
for the king ” but she understood only a very small part of what he said
and was bewildered by his manner  the un-man made capital out of this
speech 

but through all these ups and downs  all changes of the front line  all
counter-attacks and stands and withdrawals  ransom came to see more and
more clearly the strategy of the whole affair  the ladys response to
the suggestion of becoming a risk-bearer  a tragic pioneer  was still a
response made chiefly out of her love for the king and for her unborn
children  and even  in a sense  of maleldil himself  the idea that he
might not really wish to be obeyed to the letter was the sluice through
which the whole flood of suggestion had been admitted to her mind  but
mixed with this response  from the moment when the un-man began its
tragic stories  there was the faintest touch of theatricality  the first
hint of a self-admiring inclination to seize a grand rôle in the drama
of her world  it was clear that the un-mans whole effort was to
increase this element  as long as this was but one drop  so to speak  in
the sea of her mind  he would not really succeed  perhaps  while it
remained so  she was protected from actual disobedience  perhaps no
rational creature  until such a motive became dominant  could really
throw away happiness for anything quite so vague as the tempters
chatter about deeper life and the upward path  the veiled egoism in the
conception of noble revolt must be increased  and ransom thought 
despite many rallies on her part and many set-backs suffered by the
enemy  that it was  very slowly and yet perceptibly  increasing  the
matter was  of course  cruelly complicated  what the un-man said was
always very nearly true  certainly it must be part of the divine plan
that this happy creature should mature  should become more and more a
creature of free choice  should become  in a sense  more distinct from
god and from her husband in order thereby to be at one with them in a
richer fashion  in fact  he had seen this very process going on from the
moment at which he met her  and had  unconsciously  assisted it  this
present temptation  if conquered  would itself be the next  and
greatest  step in the same direction  an obedience freer  more reasoned 
more conscious than any she had known before  was being put in her
power  but for that very reason the fatal false step which  once taken 
would thrust her down into the terrible slavery of appetite and hate and
economics and government which our race knows so well  could be made to
sound so like the true one  what made him feel sure that the dangerous
element in her interest was growing was her progressive disregard of the
plain intellectual bones of the problem  it became harder to recall her
mind to the  data —a command from maleldil  a complete uncertainty about
the results of breaking it  and a present happiness so great that hardly
any change could be for the better  the turgid swell of indistinctly
splendid images which the un-man aroused  and the transcendent
importance of the central image  carried all this away  she was still in
her innocence  no evil intention had been formed in her mind  but if her
will was uncorrupted  half her imagination was already filled with
bright  poisonous shapes  “this cant go on ” thought ransom for the
second time  but all his arguments proved in the long run unavailing 
and it did go on 

there came a night when he was so tired that towards morning he fell
into a leaden sleep and slept far into the following day  he woke to
find himself alone  a great horror came over him  “what could i have
done  what could i have done ” he cried out  for he thought that all was
lost  with sick heart and sore head he staggered to the edge of the
island  his idea was to find a fish and to pursue the truants to the
fixed land where he felt little doubt that they had gone  in the
bitterness and confusion of his mind he forgot that he had no notion in
which direction that land now lay nor how far it was distant  hurrying
through the woods  he emerged into an open place and suddenly found that
he was not alone  two human figures  robed to their feet  stood before
him  silent under the yellow sky  their clothes were of purple and blue 
their heads wore chaplets of silver leaves  and their feet were bare 
they seemed to him to be  the one the ugliest  and the other the most
beautiful  of the children of men  then one of them spoke and he
realised that they were none other than the green lady herself and the
haunted body of weston  the robes were of feathers  and he knew well the
perelandrian birds from which they had been derived  the art of the
weaving  if weaving it could be called  was beyond his comprehension 

“welcome  piebald ” said the lady  “you have slept long  what do you
think of us in our leaves ”

“the birds ” said ransom  “the poor birds  what has he done to them ”

“he has found the feathers somewhere ” said the lady carelessly  “they
drop them ”

“why have you done this  lady ”

“he has been making me older again  why did you never tell me  piebald ”

“tell you what ”

“we never knew  this one showed me that the trees have leaves and the
beasts have fur  and said that in your world the men and women also hung
beautiful things about them  why do you not tell us how we look  oh 
piebald  piebald  i hope this is not going to be another of the new
goods from which you draw back your hand  it cannot be new to you if
they all do it in your world ”

“ah ” said ransom  “but it is different there  it is cold ”

“so the stranger said ” she answered  “but not in all parts of your
world  he says they do it even where it is warm ”

“has he said why they do it ”

“to be beautiful  why else ” said the lady  with some wonder in her
face 

“thank heaven ” thought ransom  “he is only teaching her vanity”  for he
had feared something worse  yet could it be possible  in the long run 
to wear clothes without learning modesty  and through modesty
lasciviousness 

“do you think we are more beautiful ” said the lady  interrupting his
thoughts 

“no ” said ransom  and then  correcting himself  “i dont know ” it was 
indeed  not easy to reply  the un-man  now that westons prosaic shirt
and shorts were concealed  looked a more exotic and therefore a more
imaginatively  less squalidly  hideous figure  as for the lady—that she
looked in some way worse was not doubtful  yet there is a plainness in
nudity—as we speak of “plain” bread  a sort of richness  a flamboyancy 
a concession  as it were  to lower conceptions of the beautiful  had
come with the purple robe  for the first  and last  time she appeared to
him at that moment as a woman whom an earth-born man might conceivably
love  and this was intolerable  the ghastly inappropriateness of the
idea had  all in one moment  stolen something from the colours of the
landscape and the scent of the flowers 

“do you think we are more beautiful ” repeated the lady 

“what does it matter ” said ransom dully 

“everyone should wish to be as beautiful as they can ” she answered 
“and we cannot see ourselves ”

“we can ” said westons body 

“how can this be ” said the lady  turning to it  “even if you could roll
your eyes right round to look inside they would see only blackness ”

“not that way ” it answered  “i will show you ” it walked a few paces
away to where westons pack lay in the yellow turf  with that curious
distinctness which often falls upon us when we are anxious and
preoccupied ransom noticed the exact make and pattern of the pack  it
must have been from the same shop in london where he had bought his own 
and that little fact  suddenly reminding him that weston had once been a
man  that he too had once had pleasures and pains and a human mind 
almost brought the tears into his eyes  the horrible fingers which
weston would never use again worked at the buckles and brought out a
small bright object—an english pocket mirror that might have cost
three-and-six  he handed it to the green lady  she turned it over in her
hands 

“what is it  what am i to do with it ” she said 

“look in it ” said the un-man 

“how ”

“look ” he said  then taking it from her he held it up to her face  she
stared for quite an appreciable time without apparently making anything
of it  then she started back with a cry and covered her face  ransom
started too  it was the first time he had seen her the mere passive
recipient of any emotion  the world about him was big with change 

“oh—oh ” she cried  “what is it  i saw a face ”

“only your own face  beautiful one ” said the un-man 

“i know ” said the lady  still averting her eyes from the mirror  “my
face—out there—looking at me  am i growing older or is it something
else  i feel       i feel       my heart is beating too hard  i am not
warm  what is it ” she glanced from one of them to the other  the
mysteries had all vanished from her face  it was as easy to read as that
of a man in a shelter when a bomb is coming 

“what is it ” she repeated 

“it is called fear ” said westons mouth  then the creature turned its
face full on ransom and grinned 

“fear ” she said  “this is fear ” pondering the discovery  then  with
abrupt finality  “i do not like it ”

“it will go away ” said the un-man  when ransom interrupted 

“it will never go away if you do what he wishes  it is into more and
more fear that he is leading you ”

“it is ” said the un-man  “into the great waves and through them and
beyond  now that you know fear  you see that it must be you who shall
taste it on behalf of your race  you know the king will not  you do not
wish him to  but there is no cause for fear in this little thing  rather
for joy  what is fearful in it ”

“things being two when they are one ” replied the lady decisively  “that
thing”  she pointed at the mirror  “is me and not me ”

“but if you do not look you will never know how beautiful you are ”

“it comes into my mind  stranger ” she answered  “that a fruit does not
eat itself  and a man cannot be together with himself ”

“a fruit cannot do that because it is only a fruit ” said the un-man 
“but we can do it  we call this thing a mirror  a man can love himself 
and be together with himself  that is what it means to be a man or a
woman—to walk alongside oneself as if one were a second person and to
delight in ones own beauty  mirrors were made to teach this art ”

“is it a good ” said the lady 

“no ” said ransom 

“how can you find out without trying ” said the un-man 

“if you try it and it is not good ” said ransom  “how do you know
whether you will be able to stop doing it ”

“i am walking alongside myself already ” said the lady  “but i do not
yet know what i look like  if i have become two i had better know what
the other is  as for you  piebald  one look will show me this womans
face and why should i look more than once ”

she took the mirror  timidly but firmly  from the un-man and looked into
it in silence for the better part of a minute  then she let it sink and
stood holding it at her side 

“it is very strange ” she said at last 

“it is very beautiful ” said the un-man  “do you not think so ”

“yes ”

“but you have not yet found what you set out to find ”

“what was that  i have forgotten ”

“whether the robe of feathers made you more beautiful or less ”

“i saw only a face ”

“hold it farther away and you will see the whole of the alongside
woman—the other who is yourself  or no—i will hold it ”

the commonplace suggestions of the scene became grotesque at this stage 
she looked at herself first with the robe  then without it  then with it
again  finally she decided against it and threw it away  the un-man
picked it up 

“will you not keep it ” he said  “you might wish to carry it on some
days even if you do not wish for it on all days ”

“ keep  it ” she asked  not clearly understanding 

“i had forgotten ” said the un-man  “i had forgotten that you would not
live on the fixed land nor build a house nor in any way become mistress
of your own days   keeping  means putting a thing where you know you can
always find it again  and where rain  and beasts  and other people
cannot reach it  i would give you this mirror to keep  it would be the
queens mirror  a gift brought into the world from deep heaven  the
other women would not have it  but you have reminded me  there can be no
gifts  no keeping  no foresight while you live as you do—from day to
day  like the beasts ”

but the lady did not appear to be listening to him  she stood like one
almost dazed with the richness of a day-dream  she did not look in the
least like a woman who is thinking about a new dress  the expression of
her face was noble  it was a great deal too noble  greatness  tragedy 
high sentiment—these were obviously what occupied her thoughts  ransom
perceived that the affair of the robes and the mirror had been only
superficially concerned with what is commonly called female vanity  the
image of her beautiful body had been offered to her only as a means to
awake the far more perilous image of her great soul  the external and 
as it were  dramatic conception of the self was the enemys true aim  he
was making her mind a theatre in which that phantom self should hold the
stage  he had already written the play 




                                 eleven


because he had slept so late that morning ransom found it easy to keep
awake the following night  the sea had become calm and there was no
rain  he sat upright in the darkness with his back against a tree  the
others were close beside him—the lady  to judge by her breathing  asleep
and the un-man doubtless waiting to arouse her and resume its
solicitations the moment ransom should doze  for the third time  more
strongly than ever before  it came into his head  “this cant go on ”

the enemy was using third degree methods  it seemed to ransom that  but
for a miracle  the ladys resistance was bound to be worn away in the
end  why did no miracle come  or rather  why no miracle on the right
side  for the presence of the enemy was in itself a kind of miracle  had
hell a prerogative to work wonders  why did heaven work none  not for
the first time he found himself questioning divine justice  he could not
understand why maleldil should remain absent when the enemy was there in
person 

but while he was thinking this  as suddenly and sharply as if the solid
darkness about him had spoken with articulate voice  he knew that
maleldil was not absent  that sense—so very welcome yet never welcomed
without the overcoming of a certain resistance—that sense of the
presence which he had once or twice before experienced on perelandra 
returned to him  the darkness was packed quite full  it seemed to press
upon his trunk so that he could hardly use his lungs  it seemed to close
in on his skull like a crown of intolerable weight so that for a space
he could hardly think  moreover  he became aware in some indefinable
fashion that it had never been absent  that only some unconscious
activity of his own had succeeded in ignoring it for the past few days 

inner silence is for our race a difficult achievement  there is a
chattering part of the mind which continues  until it is corrected  to
chatter on even in the holiest places  thus  while one part of ransom
remained  as it were  prostrated in a hush of fear and love that
resembled a kind of death  something else inside him  wholly unaffected
by reverence  continued to pour queries and objections into his brain 
“its all very well ” said this voluble critic  “a presence of  that 
sort  but the enemy is really here  really saying and doing things 
where is maleldils representative ”

the answer which came back to him  quick as a fencers or a tennis
players  riposte   out of the silence and the darkness  almost took his
breath away  it seemed blasphemous  “anyway  what can i do ” babbled the
voluble self  “ive done all i can  ive talked till im sick of it 
its no good  i tell you ” he tried to persuade himself that he  ransom 
could not possibly be maleldils representative as the un-man was the
representative of hell  the suggestion was  he argued  itself
diabolical—a temptation to fatuous pride  to megalomania  he was
horrified when the darkness simply flung back this argument in his face 
almost impatiently  and then—he wondered how it had escaped him till
now—he was forced to perceive that his own coming to perelandra was at
least as much of a marvel as the enemys  that miracle on the right
side  which he had demanded  had in fact occurred  he himself was the
miracle 

“oh  but this is nonsense ” said the voluble self  he  ransom  with his
ridiculous piebald body and his ten times defeated arguments—what sort
of a miracle was that  his mind darted hopefully down a side-alley that
seemed to promise escape  very well then  he  had  been brought here
miraculously  he was in gods hands  as long as he did his best—and he
 had  done his best—god would see to the final issue  he had not
succeeded  but he had done his best  no one could do more  “tis not in
mortals to command success ” he must not be worried about the final
result  maleldil would see to that  and maleldil would bring him safe
back to earth after his very real  though unsuccessful  efforts 
probably maleldils real intention was that he should publish to the
human race the truths he had learned on the planet venus  as for the
fate of venus  that could not really rest upon his shoulders  it was in
gods hands  one must be content to leave it there  one must have faith 
     

it snapped like a violin string  not one rag of all this evasion was
left  relentlessly  unmistakably  the darkness pressed down upon him the
knowledge that this picture of the situation was utterly false  his
journey to perelandra was not a moral exercise  nor a sham fight  if the
issue lay in maleldils hands  ransom and the lady  were  those hands 
the fate of a world really depended on how they behaved in the next few
hours  the thing was irreducibly  nakedly real  they could  if they
chose  decline to save the innocence of this new race  and if they
declined its innocence would not be saved  it rested with no other
creature in all time or all space  this he saw clearly  though as yet he
had no inkling of what he could do 

the voluble self protested  wildly  swiftly  like the propeller of a
ship racing when it is out of the water  the imprudence  the unfairness 
the absurdity of it  did maleldil  want  to lose worlds  what was the
sense of so arranging things that anything really important should
finally and absolutely depend on such a man of straw as himself  and at
that moment  far away on earth  as he now could not help remembering 
men were at war  and white-faced subalterns and freckled corporals who
had but lately begun to shave  stood in horrible gaps or crawled forward
in deadly darkness  awaking  like him  to the preposterous truth that
all really depended on their actions  and far away in time horatius
stood on the bridge  and constantine settled in his mind whether he
would or would not embrace the new religion  and eve herself stood
looking upon the forbidden fruit and the heaven of heavens waited for
her decision  he writhed and ground his teeth  but could not help
seeing  thus  and not otherwise  the world was made  either something or
nothing must depend on individual choices  and if something  who could
set bounds to it  a stone may determine the course of a river  he was
that stone at this horrible moment which had become the centre of the
whole universe  the eldila of all worlds  the sinless organisms of
everlasting light  were silent in deep heaven to see what elwin ransom
of cambridge would do 

then came blessed relief  he suddenly realised that he did not know what
he  could  do  he almost laughed with joy  all this horror had been
premature  no definite task was before him  all that was being demanded
of him was a general and preliminary resolution to oppose the enemy in
any mode which circumstances might show to be desirable  in fact—and he
flew back to the comforting words as a child flies back to its mothers
arms—“to do his best”—or rather  to go on doing his best  for he had
really been doing it all along  “what bug-bears we make of things
unnecessarily ” he murmured  settling himself in a slightly more
comfortable position  a mild flood of what appeared to him to be
cheerful and rational piety rose and engulfed him 

hullo  what was this  he sat straight upright again  his heart beating
wildly against his side  his thoughts had stumbled on an idea from which
they started back as a man starts back when he has touched a hot poker 
but this time the idea was really too childish to entertain  this time
it  must  be a deception  risen from his own mind  it stood to reason
that a struggle with the devil meant a  spiritual  struggle       the
notion of a physical combat was only fit for a savage  if only it  were 
as simple as that       but here the voluble self had made a fatal
mistake  the habit of imaginative honesty was too deeply engrained in
ransom to let him toy for more than a second with the pretence that he
feared bodily strife with the un-man less than he feared anything else 
vivid pictures crowded upon him       the deadly cold of those hands  he
had touched the creature accidentally some hours before        the long
metallic nails       ripping off narrow strips of flesh  pulling out
tendons  one would die slowly  up to the very end that cruel idiocy
would smile into ones face  one would give way long before one died—beg
for mercy  promise it help  worship  anything 

it was fortunate that something so horrible should be so obviously out
of the question  almost  but not quite  ransom decreed that whatever the
silence and the darkness seemed to be saying about this  no such crude 
materialistic struggle could possibly be what maleldil really intended 
any suggestion to the contrary must be only his own morbid fancy  it
would degrade the spiritual warfare to the condition of mere mythology 
but here he got another check  long since on mars  and more strongly
since he came to perelandra  ransom had been perceiving that the triple
distinction of truth from myth and of both from fact was purely
terrestrial—was part and parcel of that unhappy division between soul
and body which resulted from the fall  even on earth the sacraments
existed as a permanent reminder that the division was neither wholesome
nor final  the incarnation had been the beginning of its disappearance 
in perelandra it would have no meaning at all  whatever happened here
would be of such a nature that earth-men would call it mythological  all
this he had thought before  now he knew it  the presence in the
darkness  never before so formidable  was putting these truths into his
hands  like terrible jewels 

the voluble self was almost thrown out of its argumentative
stride—became for some seconds as the voice of a mere whimpering child
begging to be let off  to be allowed to go home  then it rallied  it
explained precisely where the absurdity of a physical battle with the
un-man lay  it would be quite irrelevant to the spiritual issue  if the
lady were to be kept in obedience only by the forcible removal of the
tempter  what was the use of that  what would it prove  and if the
temptation were not a proving or testing  why was it allowed to happen
at all  did maleldil suggest that our own world might have been saved if
the elephant had accidentally trodden on the serpent a moment before eve
was about to yield  was it as easy and as un-moral as that  the thing
was patently absurd 

the terrible silence went on  it became more and more like a face  a
face not without sadness  that looks upon you while you are telling
lies  and never interrupts  but gradually you know that it knows  and
falter  and contradict yourself  and lapse into silence  the voluble
self petered out in the end  almost the darkness said to ransom  “you
know you are only wasting time ” every minute it became clearer to him
that the parallel he had tried to draw between eden and perelandra was
crude and imperfect  what had happened on earth  when maleldil was born
a man at bethlehem  had altered the universe for ever  the new world of
perelandra was not a mere repetition of the old world tellus  maleldil
never repeated himself  as the lady had said  the same wave never came
twice  when eve fell  god was not man  he had not yet made men members
of his body  since then he had  and through them henceforward he would
save and suffer  one of the purposes for which he had done all this was
to save perelandra not through himself but through himself in ransom  if
ransom refused  the plan  so far  miscarried  for that point in the
story  a story far more complicated than he had conceived  it was he who
had been selected  with a strange sense of “fallings from him 
vanishings ” he perceived that you might just as well call perelandra 
not tellus  the centre  you might look upon the perelandrian story as
merely an indirect consequence of the incarnation on earth  or you might
look on the earth story as mere preparation for the new worlds of which
perelandra was the first  the one was neither more nor less true than
the other  nothing was more or less important than anything else 
nothing was a copy or model of anything else 

at the same time he also perceived that his voluble self had begged the
question  up to this point the lady had repelled her assailant  she was
shaken and weary  and there were some stains perhaps in her imagination 
but she had stood  in that respect the story already differed from
anything that he certainly knew about the mother of our own race  he did
not know whether eve had resisted at all  or if so  for how long  still
less did he know how the story would have ended if she had  if the
“serpent” had been foiled  and returned the next day  and the next      
what then  would the trial have lasted for ever  how would maleldil have
stopped it  here on perelandra his own intuition had been not that no
temptation must occur but that “this cant go on ” this stopping of a
third-degree solicitation  already more than once refused  was a problem
to which the terrestrial fall offered no clue—a new task  and for that
new task a new character in the drama  who appeared  most unfortunately 
to be himself  in vain did his mind hark back  time after time  to the
book of genesis  asking “what would have happened ” but to this the
darkness gave him no answer  patiently and inexorably it brought him
back to the here and the now  and to the growing certainty of what was
here and now demanded  almost he felt that the words “would have
happened” were meaningless—mere invitations to wander in what the lady
would have called an “alongside world” which had no reality  only the
actual was real  and every actual situation was new  here in perelandra
the temptation would be stopped by ransom  or it would not be stopped at
all  the voice—for it was almost with a voice that he was now
contending—seemed to create around this alternative an infinite vacancy 
this chapter  this page  this very sentence  in the cosmic story was
utterly and eternally itself  no other passage that had occurred or ever
would occur could be substituted for it 

he fell back on a different line of defence  how  could  he fight the
immortal enemy  even if he were a fighting man—instead of a sedentary
scholar with weak eyes and a baddish wound from the last war—what use
was there in fighting it  it couldnt be killed  could it  but the
answer was almost immediately plain  westons body could be destroyed 
and presumably that body was the enemys only foothold in perelandra  by
that body  when that body still obeyed a human will  it had entered the
new world  expelled from it  it would doubtless have no other
habitation  it had entered that body at westons own invitation  and
without such invitation could enter no other  ransom remembered that the
unclean spirits  in the bible  had a horror of being cast out into the
“deep ” and thinking of these things he perceived at last  with a
sinking of heart  that if physical action were indeed demanded of him 
it was an action  by ordinary standards  neither impossible nor
hopeless  on the physical plane it was one middle-aged  sedentary body
against another  and both unarmed save for fists and teeth and nails  at
the thought of these details  terror and disgust overcame him  to kill
the thing with such weapons  he remembered his killing of the frog 
would be a nightmare  to be killed—who knew how slowly —was more than he
could face  that he would be killed he felt certain  “when ” he asked 
“did i ever win a fight in all my life ”

he was no longer making efforts to resist the conviction of what he must
do  he had exhausted all his efforts  the answer was plain beyond all
subterfuge  the voice out of the night spoke it to him in such
unanswerable fashion that  though there was no noise  he almost felt it
must wake the woman who slept close by  he was faced with the
impossible  this he must do  this he could not do  in vain he reminded
himself of the things that unbelieving boys might at this moment be
doing on earth for a lesser cause  his will was in that valley where the
appeal to shame becomes useless—nay  makes the valley darker and deeper 
he believed he could face the un-man with firearms  even that he could
stand up unarmed and face certain death if the creature had retained
westons revolver  but to come to grips with it  to go voluntarily into
those dead yet living arms  to grapple with it  naked chest to naked
chest        terrible follies came into his mind  he would fail to obey
the voice  but it would be all right because he would repent later on 
when he was back on earth  he would lose his nerve as st  peter had
done  and be  like st  peter  forgiven  intellectually  of course  he
knew the answer to these temptations perfectly well  but he was at one
of those moments when all the utterances of intellect sound like
twice-told tales  then some cross-wind of the mind changed his mood 
perhaps he would fight and win  perhaps not even be badly mauled  but no
faintest hint of a guarantee in that direction came to him from the
darkness  the future was black as the night itself 

“it is not for nothing that you are named ransom ” said the voice 

and he knew that this was no fancy of his own  he knew it for a very
curious reason—because he had known for many years that his surname was
derived not from  ransom  but from  ranolfs son   it would never have
occurred to him thus to associate the two words  to connect the name
ransom with the act of ransoming would have been for him a mere pun  but
even his voluble self did not now dare to suggest that the voice was
making a play upon words  all in a moment of time he perceived that what
was  to human philologists  a mere accidental resemblance of two sounds 
was in truth no accident  the whole distinction between things
accidental and things designed  like the distinction between fact and
myth  was purely terrestrial  the pattern is so large that within the
little frame of earthly experience there appear pieces of it between
which we can see no connection  and other pieces between which we can 
hence we rightly  for our use  distinguish the accidental from the
essential  but step outside that frame and the distinction drops down
into the void  fluttering useless wings  he had been forced out of the
frame  caught up into the larger pattern  he knew now why the old
philosophers had said that there is no such thing as chance or fortune
beyond the moon  before his mother had born him  before his ancestors
had been called ransoms  before  ransom  had been the name for a payment
that delivers  before the world was made  all these things had so stood
together in eternity that the very significance of the pattern at this
point lay in their coming together in just this fashion  and he bowed
his head and groaned and repined against his fate—to be still a man and
yet to be forced up into the metaphysical world  to enact what
philosophy only thinks 

“my name also is ransom ” said the voice 

it was some time before the purport of this saying dawned upon him  he
whom the other worlds call maleldil  was the worlds ransom  his own
ransom  well he knew  but to what purpose was it said now  before the
answer came to him he felt its insufferable approach and held out his
arms before him as if he could keep it from forcing open the door of his
mind  but it came  so  that  was the real issue  if he now failed  this
world also would hereafter be redeemed  if he were not the ransom 
another would be  yet nothing was ever repeated  not a second
crucifixion  perhaps—who knows—not even a second incarnation       some
act of even more appalling love  some glory of yet deeper humility  for
he had seen already how the pattern grows and how from each world it
sprouts into the next through some other dimension  the small external
evil which satan had done in malacandra was only as a line  the deeper
evil he had done in earth was as a square  if venus fell  her evil would
be a cube—her redemption beyond conceiving  yet redeemed she would be 
he had long known that great issues hung on his choice  but as he now
realised the true width of the frightful freedom that was being put into
his hands—a width to which all merely spatial infinity seemed narrow—he
felt like a man brought out under naked heaven  on the edge of a
precipice  into the teeth of a wind that came howling from the pole  he
had pictured himself  till now  standing before the lord  like peter 
but it was worse  he sat before him like pilate  it lay with him to save
or to spill  his hands had been reddened  as all mens hands have been 
in the slaying before the foundation of the world  now  if he chose  he
could dip them again in the same blood  “mercy ” he groaned  and then 
“lord  why me ” but there was no answer 

the thing still seemed impossible  but gradually something happened to
him which had happened to him only twice before in his life  it had
happened once while he was trying to make up his mind to do a very
dangerous job in the last war  it had happened again while he was
screwing his resolution to go and see a certain man in london and make
to him an excessively embarrassing confession which justice demanded  in
both cases the thing had seemed a sheer impossibility  he had not
thought but known that  being what he was  he was psychologically
incapable of doing it  and then  without any apparent movement of the
will  as objective and unemotional as the reading on a dial  there had
arisen before him  with perfect certitude  the knowledge “about this
time to-morrow you will have done the impossible ” the same thing
happened now  his fear  his shame  his love  all his arguments  were not
altered in the least  the thing was neither more nor less dreadful than
it had been before  the only difference was that he knew—almost as a
historical proposition—that it was going to be done  he might beg  weep 
or rebel—might curse or adore—sing like a martyr or blaspheme like a
devil  it made not the slightest difference  the thing was going to be
done  there was going to arrive  in the course of time  a moment at
which he would have done it  the future act stood there  fixed and
unalterable as if he had already performed it  it was a mere irrelevant
detail that it happened to occupy the position we call future instead of
that which we call past  the whole struggle was over  and yet there
seemed to have been no moment of victory  you might say  if you liked 
that the power of choice had been simply set aside and an inflexible
destiny substituted for it  on the other hand  you might say that he had
been delivered from the rhetoric of his passions and had emerged into
unassailable freedom  ransom could not  for the life of him  see any
difference between these two statements  predestination and freedom were
apparently identical  he could no longer see any meaning in the many
arguments he had heard on this subject 

no sooner had he discovered that he would certainly try to kill the
un-man to-morrow than the doing of it appeared to him a smaller matter
than he had supposed  he could hardly remember why he had accused
himself of megalomania when the idea first occurred to him  it was true
that if he left it undone  maleldil himself would do some greater thing
instead  in that sense  he stood for maleldil  but no more than eve
would have stood for him by simply not eating the apple  or than any man
stands for him in doing any good action  as there was no comparison in
person  so there was none in suffering—or only such comparison as may be
between a man who burns his finger putting out a spark and a fireman who
loses his life in fighting a conflagration because that spark was not
put out  he asked no longer “why me ” it might as well be he as another 
it might as well be any other choice as this  the fierce light which he
had seen resting on this moment of decision rested in reality on all 

“i have cast your enemy into sleep ” said the voice  “he will not wake
till morning  get up  walk twenty paces back into the wood  there sleep 
your sister sleeps also ”




                                 twelve


when some dreaded morning comes we usually wake fully to it at once 
ransom passed with no intermediate stages from dreamless sleep to a full
consciousness of his task  he found himself alone—the island gently
rocking on a sea that was neither calm nor stormy  the golden light 
glinting through indigo trunks of trees  told him in which direction the
water lay  he went to it and bathed  then  having landed again  he lay
down and drank  he stood for a few minutes running his hands through his
wet hair and stroking his limbs  looking down at his own body he noticed
how greatly the sunburn on one side and the pallor on the other had
decreased  he would hardly be christened piebald if the lady were now to
meet him for the first time  his colour had become more like ivory  and
his toes  after so many days of nakedness  had begun to lose the
cramped  squalid shape imposed by boots  altogether he thought better of
himself as a human animal than he had done before  he felt pretty
certain that he would never again wield an un-maimed body until a
greater morning came for the whole universe  and he was glad that the
instrument had been thus tuned up to concert pitch before he had to
surrender it  “when i wake up after thy image  i shall be satisfied ” he
said to himself 

presently he walked into the woods  accidentally—for he was at the
moment intent on food—he blundered through a whole cloud of the arboreal
bubbles  the pleasure was as sharp as when he had first experienced it 
and his very stride was different as he emerged from them  although this
was to be his last meal  he did not even now feel it proper to look for
any favourite fruit  but what met him was gourds  “a good breakfast on
the morning youre hanged ” he thought whimsically as he let the empty
shell drop from his hand—filled for the moment with such pleasure as
seemed to make the whole world a dance  “all said and done ” he thought 
“its been worth it  i have had a time  i have lived in paradise ”

he went a little farther in the wood  which grew thickly hereabout  and
almost tripped over the sleeping form of the lady  it was unusual for
her to be sleeping at this time of the day  and he assumed it was
maleldils doing  “i shall never see her again ” he thought  and then 
“i shall never again look on a female body in quite the same way as i
look on this ” as he stood looking down on her  what was most with him
was an intense and orphaned longing that he might  if only for once 
have seen the great mother of his own race thus  in her innocence and
splendour  “other things  other blessings  other glories ” he murmured 
“but never that  never in all worlds  that  god can make good use of all
that happens  but the loss is real ” he looked at her once again and
then walked abruptly past the place where she lay  “i was right ” he
thought  “it couldnt have gone on  it was time to stop it ”

it took him a long time  wandering like this  in and out of the dark yet
coloured thickets  before he found his enemy  he came on his old friend
the dragon  just as he had first seen it  coiled about the trunk of a
tree  but it also was asleep  and now he noticed that ever since he
awoke he had perceived no chattering of birds  no rustling of sleek
bodies or peering of brown eyes through the leafage  nor heard any noise
but that of water  it seemed that the lord god had cast that whole
island or perhaps that whole world into deep sleep  for a moment this
gave him a sense of desolation  but almost at once he rejoiced that no
memory of blood and rage should be left imprinted in these happy minds 

after about an hour  suddenly rounding a little clump of bubble-trees he
found himself face to face with the un-man  “is it wounded already ” he
thought as the first vision of a blood-stained chest broke on him  then
he saw that of course it was not its own blood  a bird  already half
plucked and with beak wide open in the soundless yell of strangulation 
was feebly struggling in its long clever hands  ransom found himself
acting before he knew what he had done  some memory of boxing at his
preparatory school must have awaked  for he found he had delivered a
straight left with all his might on the un-mans jaw  but he had
forgotten that he was not fighting with gloves  what recalled him to
himself was the pain as his fist crashed against the jaw-bone—it seemed
almost to have broken his knuckles—and the sickening jar all up his arm 
he stood still for a second under the shock of it and this gave the
un-man time to fall back about six paces  it too had not liked the first
taste of the encounter  it had apparently bitten its tongue  for blood
came bubbling out of the mouth when it tried to speak  it was still
holding the bird 

“so you mean to try strength ” it said in english  speaking thick 

“put down that bird ” said ransom 

“but this is very foolish ” said the un-man  “do you not know who i am ”

“i know  what  you are ” said ransom  “which of them doesnt matter ”

“and you think  little one ” it answered  “that you can fight with me 
you think he will help you  perhaps  many thought that  ive known him
longer than you  little one  they all think hes going to help them—till
they come to their senses screaming recantations too late in the middle
of the fire  mouldering in concentration camps  writhing under saws 
jibbering in mad-houses  or nailed on to crosses  could he help
himself ”—and the creature suddenly threw back its head and cried in a
voice so loud that it seemed the golden sky-roof must break  “ eloi 
eloi  lama sabachthani  ”

and the moment it had done so  ransom felt certain that the sounds it
had made were perfect aramaic of the first century  the un-man was not
quoting  it was remembering  these were the very words spoken from the
cross  treasured through all those years in the burning memory of the
outcast creature which had heard them  and now brought forward in
hideous parody  the horror made him momentarily sick  before he had
recovered the un-man was upon him  howling like a gale  with eyes so
wide opened that they seemed to have no lids  and with all its hair
rising on its scalp  it had him caught tightly to its chest  with its
arms about him  and its nails were ripping great strips off his back 
his own arms were inside its embrace and  pummelling wildly  he could
get no blow at it  he turned his head and bit deeply into the muscle of
its right arm  at first without success  then deeper  it gave a howl 
tried to hold on  and then suddenly he was free  its defence was for an
instant unready and he found himself raining punches about the region of
its heart  faster and harder than he had supposed possible  he could
hear through its open mouth the great gusts of breath that he was
knocking out of it  then its hands came up again  fingers arched like
claws  it was not trying to box  it wanted to grapple  he knocked its
right arm aside with a horrible shock of bone against bone and caught it
a jab on the fleshy part of the chin  at the same moment its nails tore
his right  he grabbed at its arms  more by luck than by skill he got it
held by both wrists 

what followed for the next minute or so would hardly have looked like a
fight at all to any spectator  the un-man was trying with every ounce of
power it could find in westons body to wrench its arms free from
ransoms hands  and he  with every ounce of his power  was trying to
retain his manacle hold round its wrists  but this effort  which sent
streams of sweat down the backs of both combatants  resulted in a slow
and seemingly leisurely  and even aimless  movement of both pairs of
arms  neither could for the moment hurt the other  the un-man bent
forward its head and tried to bite  but ransom straightened his arms and
kept it at arms length  there seemed no reason why this should ever
end 

then suddenly it shot out its leg and crooked it behind his knee  he was
nearly taken off his feet  movements became quick and flurried on both
sides  ransom in his turn tried to trip  and failed  he started bending
the enemys left arm back by main force with some idea of breaking or at
least spraining it  but in the effort to do so he must have weakened his
hold on the other wrist  it got its right free  he had just time to
close his eyes before the nails tore fiercely down his cheek and the
pain put an end to the blows his left was already raining on its ribs  a
second later—he did not know quite how it happened—they were standing
apart  their chests heaving in great gasps  each staring at the other 

both were doubtless sorry spectacles  ransom could not see his own
wounds but he seemed to be covered with blood  the enemys eyes were
nearly closed and the body  wherever the remains of westons shirt did
not conceal it  was a mass of what would soon be bruises  this  and its
laboured breathing  and the very taste of its strength in their
grapples  had altered ransoms state of mind completely  he had been
astonished to find it no stronger  he had all along  despite what reason
told him  expected that the strength of its body would be superhuman 
diabolical  he had reckoned on arms that could no more be caught and
stopped than the blades of an aeroplanes propeller  but now he knew  by
actual experience  that its bodily strength was merely that of weston 
on the physical plane it was one middle-aged scholar against another 
weston had been the more powerfully built of the two men  but he was
fat  his body would not take punishment well  ransom was nimbler and
better breathed  his former certainty of death now seemed to him
ridiculous  it was a very fair match  there was no reason why he should
not win—and live 

this time it was ransom who attacked  and the second bout was much the
same as the first  what it came to was that whenever he could box ransom
was superior  whenever he came under tooth and claw he was beaten  his
mind  even in the thick of it  was now quite clear  he saw that the
issue of the day hung on a very simple question—whether loss of blood
would undo him before heavy blows on heart and kidneys undid the other 

all that rich world was asleep about them  there were no rules  no
umpire  no spectators  but mere exhaustion  constantly compelling them
to fall apart  divided the grotesque duel into rounds as accurately as
could be wished  ransom could never remember how many of these rounds
were fought  the thing became like the frantic repetitions of delirium 
and thirst a greater pain than any the adversary could inflict 
sometimes they were both on the ground together  once he was actually
astride the enemys chest  squeezing its throat with both hands and—he
found to his surprise—shouting a line out of  the battle of maldon   but
it tore his arms so with its nails and so pounded his back with its
knees that he was thrown off 

then he remembers—as one remembers an island of consciousness preceded
and followed by long anæsthesia—going forward to meet the un-man for
what seemed the thousandth time and knowing clearly that he could not
fight much more  he remembers seeing the enemy for a moment looking not
like weston but like a mandrill  and realising almost at once that this
was delirium  he wavered  then an experience that perhaps no good man
can ever have in our world came over him—a torrent of perfectly unmixed
and lawful hatred  the energy of hating  never before felt without some
guilt  without some dim knowledge that he was failing fully to
distinguish the sinner from the sin  rose into his arms and legs till he
felt that they were pillars of burning blood  what was before him
appeared no longer a creature of corrupted will  it was corruption
itself to which will was attached only as an instrument  ages ago it had
been a person  but the ruins of personality now survived in it only as
weapons at the disposal of a furious self-exiled negation  it is perhaps
difficult to understand why this filled ransom not with horror but with
a kind of joy  the joy came from finding at last what hatred was made
for  as a boy with an axe rejoices on finding a tree  or a boy with a
box of coloured chalks rejoices on finding a pile of perfectly white
paper  so he rejoiced in the perfect congruity between his emotion and
its object  bleeding and trembling with weariness as he was  he felt
that nothing was beyond his power  and when he flung himself upon the
living death  the eternal surd in the universal mathematic  he was
astonished  and yet  on a deeper level  not astonished at all  at his
own strength  his arms seemed to move quicker than his thought  his
hands taught him terrible things  he felt its ribs break  he heard its
jaw-bone crack  the whole creature seemed to be crackling and splitting
under his blows  his own pains  where it tore him  somehow failed to
matter  he felt that he could so fight  so hate with a perfect hatred 
for a whole year 

all at once he found he was beating the air  he was in such a state that
at first he could not understand what was happening—could not believe
that the un-man had fled  his momentary stupidity gave it a start  and
when he came to his senses he was just in time to see it vanishing into
the wood  with a limping uneven stride  with one arm hanging useless 
and with its dog-like howl  he dashed after it  for a second or so it
was concealed from him by the tree trunks  then it was once more in
sight  he began running with all his power  but it kept its lead 

it was a fantastic chase  in and out of the lights and shadows and up
and down the slowly moving ridges and valleys  they passed the dragon
where it slept  they passed the lady  sleeping with a smile on her face 
the un-man stooped low as it passed her with the fingers of its left
hand crooked for scratching  it would have torn her if it dared  but
ransom was close behind and it could not risk the delay  they passed
through a flock of large orange-coloured birds all fast asleep  each on
one leg  each with its head beneath its wing  so that they looked like a
grove of formal and flowery shrubs  they picked their steps where pairs
and families of the yellow wallabies lay on their backs with eyes fast
shut and their small forepaws folded on their breasts as if they were
crusaders carved on tombs  they stooped beneath branches which were
bowed down because on them lay the tree-pigs  making a comfortable noise
like a childs snore  they crashed through thickets of bubble-trees and
forgot  for the moment  their weariness  it was a large island  they
came out of the woods and rushed across wide fields of saffron or of
silver  sometimes deep to their ankles and sometimes to their waists in
the cool or poignant scents  they rushed down into yet other woods which
lay  as they approached them  at the bottom of secret valleys  but rose
before they reached them to crown the summits of lonely hills  ransom
could not gain on his quarry  it was a wonder that any creature so
maimed as its uneven strides showed it to be  could maintain that pace 
if the ankle were really sprained  as he suspected  it must suffer
indescribably at every step  then the horrible thought came into his
mind that perhaps it could somehow hand over the pain to be borne by
whatever remnants of westons consciousness yet survived in its body 
the idea that something which had once been of his own kind and fed at a
human breast might even now be imprisoned in the thing he was pursuing
redoubled his hatred  which was unlike nearly all other hatreds he had
ever known  for it increased his strength 

as they emerged from about the fourth wood he saw the sea before them
not thirty yards away  the un-man rushed on as if it made no distinction
between land and water and plunged in with a great splash  he could see
its head  dark against the coppery sea  as it swam  ransom rejoiced  for
swimming was the only sport in which he had ever approached excellence 
as he took the water he lost sight of the un-man for a moment  then 
looking up and shaking the wet hair from his face as he struck out in
pursuit  his hair was very long by now   he saw its whole body upright
and above the surface as though it were sitting on the sea  a second
glance and he realised that it had mounted a fish  apparently the
charmd slumber extended only to the island  for the un-man on his mount
was making good speed  it was stooping down doing something to its fish 
ransom could not see what  doubtless it would have many ways of urging
the animal to quicken its pace 

for a moment he was in despair  but he had forgotten the man-loving
nature of these sea-horses  he found almost at once that he was in a
complete shoal of the creatures  leaping and frisking to attract his
attention  in spite of their good will it was no easy matter to get
himself on to the slippery surface of the fine specimen which his
grabbing hands first reached  while he was struggling to mount  the
distance widened between him and the fugitive  but at last it was done 
settling himself behind the great goggle-eyed head he nudged the animal
with his knees  kicked it with his heels  whispered words of praise and
encouragement  and in general did all he could to awake its metal  it
began threshing its way forward  but looking ahead ransom could no
longer see any sign of the un-man  but only the long empty ridge of the
next wave coming towards him  doubtless the quarry was beyond the ridge 
then he noticed that he had no cause to be bothered about the direction 
the slope of water was dotted all over with the great fish  each marked
by a heap of yellow foam and some of them spouting as well  the un-man
possibly had not reckoned on the instinct which made them follow as
leader any of their company on whom a human being sat  they were all
forging straight ahead  no more uncertain of their course than homing
rooks or bloodhounds on a scent  as ransom and his fish rose to the top
of the wave  he found himself looking down on a wide shallow trough
shaped much like a valley in the home counties  far away and now
approaching the opposite slope was the little  dark puppet-like
silhouette of the un-man  and between it and him the whole school of
fish was spread out in three or four lines  clearly there was no danger
of losing touch  ransom was hunting him with the fish and they would not
cease to follow  he laughed aloud  “my hounds are bred out of the
spartan kind  so flewd so sanded ” he roared 

now for the first time the blessed fact that he was no longer fighting
nor even standing thrust itself upon his attention  he made to assume a
more relaxed position and was pulled up sharp by a grinding pain across
his back  he foolishly put back his hand to explore his shoulders  and
almost screamed at the pain of his own touch  his back seemed to be in
shreds and the shreds seemed to be all stuck together  at the same time
he noticed that he had lost a tooth and that nearly all the skin was
gone from his knuckles  and underneath the smarting surface pains 
deeper and more ominous aches racked him from head to foot  he had not
known he was so knocked up 

then he remembered that he was thirsty  now that he had begun to cool
and stiffen he found the task of getting a drink from the water that
raced by him extremely difficult  his first idea had been to stoop low
till his head was almost upside down and bury his face in the water  but
a single attempt cured him of that  he was reduced to putting down his
cupped hands  and even this  as his stiffness grew upon him  had to be
done with infinite caution and with many groans and gasps  it took many
minutes to get a tiny sip which merely mocked his thirst  the quenching
of that thirst kept him employed for what seemed to be half an hour—a
half-hour of sharp pains and insane pleasures  nothing had ever tasted
so good  even when he had done drinking he went on taking up water and
splashing it over himself  this would have been among the happiest
moments of his life—if only the smarting of his back did not seem to be
getting worse and if only he were not afraid that there was poison in
the cuts  his legs kept on getting stuck to the fish and having to be
unstuck with pain and care  every now and then blackness threatened to
come over him  he could easily have fainted  but he thought “this will
never do” and fixed his eyes on objects close at hand and thought plain
thoughts and so retained his consciousness 

all this time the un-man rode on before him  up-wave and down-wave  and
the fishes followed and ransom followed the fishes  there seemed to be
more of them now  as if the chase had met other shoals and gathered them
up into itself in snowball fashion  and soon there were creatures other
than fish  birds with long necks like swans—he could not tell their
colour for they looked black against the sky—came  wheeling at first 
overhead  but afterwards they settled in long straight files—all
following the un-man  the crying of these birds was often audible  and
it was the wildest sound that ransom had ever heard  the loneliest  and
the one that had least to do with man  no land was in sight  nor had
been for many hours  he was on the high seas  the waste places of
perelandra  as he had not been since his first arrival  the sea-noises
continuously filled his ear  the sea-smell  unmistakable and stirring as
that of our tellurian oceans  but quite different in its warmth and
golden sweetness  entered into his brain  it also was wild and strange 
it was not hostile  if it had been  its wildness and strangeness would
have been the less  for hostility is a relation and an enemy is not a
total stranger  it came into his head that he knew nothing at all about
this world  some day  no doubt  it would be peopled by the descendants
of the king and queen  but all its millions of years in the unpeopled
past  all its uncounted miles of laughing water in the lonely present
      did they exist solely for that  it was strange that he to whom a
wood or a morning sky on earth had sometimes been a kind of meal  should
have had to come to another planet in order to realise nature as a thing
in her own right  the diffused meaning  the inscrutable character  which
had been both in tellus and perelandra since they split off from the
sun  and which would be  in one sense  displaced by the advent of
imperial man  yet  in some other sense  not displaced at all  enfolded
him on every side and caught him into itself 




                                thirteen


darkness fell upon the waves as suddenly as if it had been poured out of
a bottle  as soon as the colours and the distances were thus taken away 
sound and pain became more emphatic  the world was reduced to a dull
ache  and sudden stabs  and the beating of the fishs fins  and the
monotonous yet infinitely varied noises of the water  then he found
himself almost falling off the fish  recovered his seat with difficulty 
and realised that he had been asleep  perhaps for hours  he foresaw that
this danger would continually recur  after some consideration he levered
himself painfully out of the narrow saddle behind its head and stretched
his body at full length along the fishs back  he parted his legs and
wound them about the creature as far as he could and did the same with
his arms  hoping that thus he could retain his mount even while
sleeping  it was the best he could do  a strange thrilling sensation
crept over him  communicated doubtless from the movement of its muscles 
it gave him the illusion of sharing in its strong bestial life  as if he
were himself becoming a fish 

long after this he found himself staring into something like a human
face  it ought to have terrified him but  as sometimes happens to us in
a dream  it did not  it was a bluish-greenish face shining apparently by
its own light  the eyes were much larger than those of a man and gave it
a goblin appearance  a fringe of corrugated membranes at the sides
suggested whiskers  with a shock he realised that he was not dreaming 
but awake  the thing was real  he was still lying  sore and wearied  on
the body of the fish and this face belonged to something that was
swimming alongside him  he remembered the swimming sub-men or mermen
whom he had seen before  he was not at all frightened  and he guessed
that the creatures reaction to him was the very same as his to it—an
uneasy  though not hostile  bewilderment  each was wholly irrelevant to
the other  they met as the branches of different trees meet when the
wind brings them together 

ransom now raised himself once more to a sitting position  he found that
the darkness was not complete  his own fish swam in a bath of
phosphorescence and so did the stranger at his side  all about him were
other blobs and daggers of blue light and he could dimly make out from
the shapes which were fish and which were the water-people  their
movements faintly indicated the contours of the waves and introduced
some hint of perspective into the night  he noticed presently that
several of the water-people in his immediate neighbourhood seemed to be
feeding  they were picking dark masses of something off the water with
their webbed frog-like hands and devouring it  as they munched  it hung
out of their mouths in bushy and shredded bundles and looked like
moustaches  it is significant that it never occurred to him to try to
establish any contact with these beings  as he had done with every other
animal on perelandra  nor did they try to establish any with him  they
did not seem to be the natural subjects of man as the other creatures
were  he got the impression that they simply shared a planet with him as
sheep and horses share a field  each species ignoring the other  later 
this came to be a trouble in his mind  but for the moment he was
occupied with a more practical problem  the sight of their eating had
reminded him that he was hungry and he was wondering whether the stuff
they ate were eatable by him  it took him a long time  scooping the
water with his fingers  to catch any of it  when at last he did it
turned out to be of the same general structure as one of our smaller
sea-weeds  and to have little bladders that popped when one pressed
them  it was tough and slippery  but not salt like the weed of a
tellurian sea  what it tasted like  he could never properly describe  it
is to be noted all through this story that while ransom was on
perelandra his sense of taste had become something more than it was on
earth  it gave knowledge as well as pleasure  though not a knowledge
that can be reduced to words  as soon as he had eaten a few mouthfuls of
the seaweed he felt his mind oddly changed  he felt the surface of the
sea to be the top of the world  he thought of the floating islands as we
think of clouds  he saw them in imagination as they would appear from
below—mats of fibre with long streamers hanging down from them  and
became startlingly conscious of his own experience in walking on the
topside of them as a miracle or a myth  he felt his memory of the green
lady and all her promised descendants and all the issues which had
occupied him ever since he came to perelandra rapidly fading from his
mind  as a dream fades when we wake  or as if it were shouldered aside
by a whole world of interests and emotions to which he could give no
name  it terrified him  in spite of his hunger he threw the rest of the
weed away 

he must have slept again  for the next scene that he remembers was in
daylight  the un-man was still visible ahead  and the shoal of fishes
was still spread out between it and him  the birds had abandoned the
chase  and now at last a full and prosaic sense of his position
descended upon him  it is a curious flaw in the reason  to judge from
ransoms experience  that when a man comes to a strange planet he at
first quite forgets its size  that whole world is so small in comparison
with his journey through space that he forgets the distances within it 
any two places in mars  or in venus  appear to him like places in the
same town  but now  as ransom looked round once more and saw nothing in
every direction but golden sky and tumbling waves  the full absurdity of
this delusion was borne in upon him  even if there were continents in
perelandra  he might well be divided from the nearest of them by the
breadth of the pacific or more  but he had no reason to suppose that
there were any  he had no reason to suppose that even the floating
islands were very numerous  or that they were equally distributed over
the surface of the planet  even if their loose archipelago spread over a
thousand square miles  what would that be but a negligible freckling in
a landless ocean that rolled for ever round a globe not much smaller
than the world of men  soon his fish would be tired  already  he
fancied  it was not swimming at its original speed  the un-man would
doubtless torture its mount to swim till it died  but he could not do
that  as he was thinking of these things and staring ahead  he saw
something that turned his heart cold  one of the other fish deliberately
turned out of line  spurted a little column of foam  dived  and
reappeared some yards away  apparently drifting  in a few minutes it was
out of sight  it had had enough 

and now the experiences of the past day and night began to make a direct
assault upon his faith  the solitude of the seas and  still more  the
experiences which had followed his taste of the seaweed  had insinuated
a doubt as to whether this world in any real sense belonged to those who
called themselves its king and queen  how could it be made for them when
most of it  in fact  was uninhabitable by them  was not the very idea
naïve and anthropomorphic in the highest degree  as for the great
prohibition  on which so much had seemed to hang—was it really so
important  what did these roarers with the yellow foam  and these
strange people who lived in them  care whether two little creatures  now
far away  lived or did not live on one particular rock  the parallelism
between the scenes he had lately witnessed and those recorded in the
book of genesis  and which had hitherto given him the feeling of knowing
by experience what other men only believe  now began to shrink in
importance  need it prove anything more than that similar irrational
 taboos  had accompanied the dawn of reason in two different worlds  it
was all very well to talk of maleldil  but where was maleldil now  if
this illimitable ocean said anything  it said something very different 
like all solitudes it was  indeed  haunted  but not by an
anthropomorphic deity  rather by the wholly inscrutable to which man and
his life remained eternally irrelevant  and beyond this ocean was space
itself  in vain did ransom try to remember that he had been in “space”
and found it heaven  tingling with a fulness of life for which infinity
itself was not one cubic inch too large  all that seemed like a dream 
that opposite mode of thought which he had often mocked and called in
mockery the empirical bogey  came surging into his mind—the great myth
of our century with its gases and galaxies  its light years and
evolutions  its nightmare perspectives of simple arithmetic in which
everything that can possibly hold significance for the mind becomes the
mere by-product of essential disorder  always till now he had belittled
it  had treated with a certain disdain its flat superlatives  its
clownish amazement that different things should be of different sizes 
its glib munificence of ciphers  even now  his reason was not quite
subdued  though his heart would not listen to his reason  part of him
still knew that the size of a thing is its least important
characteristic  that the material universe derived from the comparing
and mythopœic power within him that very majesty before which he was now
asked to abase himself  and that mere numbers could not over-awe us
unless we lent them  from our own resources  that awfulness which they
themselves could no more supply than a bankers ledger  but this
knowledge remained an abstraction  mere bigness and loneliness overbore
him 

these thoughts must have taken several hours and absorbed all his
attention  he was aroused by what he least expected—the sound of a human
voice  emerging from his reverie he saw that all the fishes had deserted
him  his own was swimming feebly  and there a few yards away  no longer
fleeing him but moving slowly towards him  was the un-man  it sat
hugging itself  its eyes almost shut up with bruises  its flesh the
colour of liver  its leg apparently broken  its mouth twisted with pain 

“ransom ” it said feebly 

ransom held his tongue  he was not going to encourage it to start that
game again 

“ransom ” it said again in a broken voice  “for gods sake speak to me ”

he glanced at it in surprise  tears were on its cheeks 

“ransom  dont cold-shoulder me ” it said  “tell me what has happened 
what have they done to us  you—youre all bleeding  my legs broken
     ” its voice died away in a whimper 

“who are you ” he asked sharply 

“oh  dont pretend you dont know me ” mumbled westons voice  “im
weston  youre ransom—elwin ransom of leicester  cambridge  the
philologist  weve had our quarrels  i know  im sorry  i dare say ive
been in the wrong  ransom  youll not leave me to die in this horrible
place  will you ”

“where did you learn aramaic ” asked ransom  keeping his eyes on the
other 

“aramaic ” said westons voice  “i dont know what youre talking about 
its not much of a game to make fun of a dying man ”

“but are you really weston ” said ransom  for he began to think that
weston had actually come back 

“who else should i be ” came the answer  with a burst of weak temper  on
the verge of tears 

“where have you been ” asked ransom 

weston—if it was weston—shuddered  “where are we now ” he asked
presently 

“in perelandra—venus  you know ” answered ransom 

“have you found the space-ship ” asked weston 

“i never saw it except at a distance ” said ransom  “and ive no idea
where it is now—a couple of hundred miles away for all i know ”

“you mean were trapped ” said weston  almost in a scream  ransom said
nothing and the other bowed his head and cried like a baby 

“come ” said ransom at last  “theres no good taking it like that  hang
it all  youd not be much better off if you were on earth  you remember
theyre having a war there  the germans may be bombing london to bits at
this moment ” then seeing the creature still crying  he added  “buck up 
weston  its only death  all said and done  we should have to die some
day  you know  we shant lack water  and hunger—without thirst—isnt too
bad  as for drowning—well  a bayonet wound  or cancer  would be worse ”

“you mean to say youre going to leave me ” said weston 

“i cant  even if i wanted to ” said ransom  “dont you see im in the
same position as yourself ”

“youll promise not to go off and leave me in the lurch ” said weston 

“all right  ill promise if you like  where could i go to ”

weston looked very slowly all round and then urged his fish a little
nearer to ransoms 

“where is        it  ” he asked in a whisper  “you know ” and he made
meaningless gestures 

“i might ask you the same question ” said ransom 

“me ” said weston  his face was  in one way and another  so disfigured
that it was hard to be sure of its expression 

“have you any idea of whats been happening to you for the last few
days ” said ransom 

weston once more looked all round him uneasily 

“its all true  you know ” he said at last 

“whats all true ” said ransom 

suddenly weston turned on him with a snarl of rage  “its all very well
for  you  ” he said  “drowning doesnt hurt and death is bound to come
anyway  and all that nonsense  what do  you  know about death  its all
true  i tell you ”

“what are you talking about ”

“ive been stuffing myself up with a lot of nonsense all my life ” said
weston  “trying to persuade myself that it matters what happens to the
human race       trying to believe that anything you can do will make
the universe bearable  its all rot  do you see ”

“and something else is truer ”

“yes ” said weston  and then was silent for a long time 

“wed better turn our fishes head on to this ” said ransom presently 
his eyes on the seas  “or well be driven apart ” weston obeyed without
seeming to notice what he did  and for a time the two men were riding
very slowly side by side 

“ill tell you whats truer ” said weston presently 

“what ”

“a little child that creeps upstairs when nobodys looking and very
slowly turns the handle to take one peep into the room where its
grandmothers dead body is laid out—and then runs away and has bad
dreams  an enormous grandmother  you understand ”

“what do you mean by saying thats truer ”

“i mean that child knows something about the universe which all science
and all religion is trying to hide ”

ransom said nothing 

“lots of things ” said weston presently  “children are afraid to go
through a churchyard at night  and the grown-ups tell them not to be
silly  but the children know better than the grown-ups  people in
central africa doing beastly things with masks on in the middle of the
night—and missionaries and civil servants say its all superstition 
well  the blacks know more about the universe than the white people 
dirty priests in back streets in dublin frightening half-witted children
to death with stories about it  youd say they are unenlightened 
theyre not  except that they think there is a way of escape  there
isnt  that is the real universe  always has been  always will be 
thats what it all  means  ”

“im not quite clear——” began ransom  when weston interrupted him 

“thats why its so important to live as long as you can  all the good
things are now—a thin little rind of what we call life  put on for show 
and then—the  real  universe for ever and ever  to thicken the rind by
one centimetre—to live one week  one day  one half-hour longer—thats
the only thing that matters  of course you dont know it  but every man
who is waiting to be hanged knows it  you say what difference does a
short reprieve make  what difference  ”

“but nobody need go there ” said ransom 

“i know thats what you believe ” said weston  “but youre wrong  its
only a small parcel of civilised people who think that  humanity as a
whole knows better  it knows—homer knew—that  all  the dead have sunk
down into the inner darkness  under the rind  all witless  all
twittering  gibbering  decaying  bogeymen  every savage knows that  all 
ghosts hate the living who are still enjoying the rind  just as old
women hate girls who still have their good looks  its quite right to be
afraid of the ghosts  youre going to be one all the same ”

“you dont believe in god ” said ransom 

“well  now  thats another point ” said weston  “ive been to church as
well as you when i was a boy  theres more sense in parts of the bible
than you religious people know  doesnt it say hes the god of the
living  not of the dead  thats just it  perhaps your god does exist—but
it makes no difference whether he does or not  no  of course you
wouldnt see it  but one day you will  i dont think youve got the idea
of the rind—the thin outer skin which we call life—really clear  picture
the universe as an infinite globe with this very thin crust on the
outside  but remember its thickness is a thickness of  time   its about
seventy years thick in the best places  we are born on the surface of it
and all our lives we are sinking through it  when weve got all the way
through then we are whats called dead  weve got into the dark part
inside  the real globe  if your god exists  hes not in the globe—hes
outside  like a moon  as we pass into the interior we pass out of his
ken  he doesnt follow us in  you would express it by saying hes not in
time—which you think comforting  in other words he stays put  out in the
light and air  outside  but we are in time  we move with the times 
that is  from his point of view  we move  away   into what he regards as
nonentity  where he never follows  that is all there is to us  all there
ever was  he may be there in what you call life  or he may not  what
difference does it make   were  not going to be there for long ”

“that could hardly be the whole story ” said ransom  “if the whole
universe were like that  then we  being parts of it  would feel at home
in such a universe  the very fact that it strikes us as monstrous——”

“yes ” interrupted weston  “that would be all very well if it wasnt
that reasoning itself is only valid as long as you stay in the rind  it
has nothing to do with the real universe  even the ordinary
scientists—like what i used to be myself—are beginning to find that out 
havent you seen the real meaning of all this modern stuff about the
dangers of extrapolation and bent space and the indeterminacy of the
atom  they dont say it in so many words  of course  but what theyre
getting to  even before they die nowadays  is what all men get to when
theyre dead—the knowledge that reality is neither rational nor
consistent nor anything else  in a sense you might say it isnt there 
real and unreal  true and false—theyre all only on the surface 
they give way the moment you press them ”

“if all this were true ” said ransom  “what would be the point of saying
it ”

“or of anything else ” replied weston  “the only point in anything is
that there isnt any point  why do ghosts want to frighten  because they
 are  ghosts  what else is there to do ”

“i get the idea ” said ransom  “that the account a man gives of the
universe  or of any other building  depends very much on where he is
standing ”

“but specially ” said weston  “on whether hes inside or out  all the
things you like to dwell upon are outsides  a planet like our own  or
like perelandra  for instance  or a beautiful human body  all the
colours and pleasant shapes are merely where it ends  where it ceases to
be  inside  what do you get  darkness  worms  heat  pressure  salt 
suffocation  stink ”

they ploughed forward for a few minutes in silence over waves which were
now growing larger  the fish seemed to be making little headway 

“of course you dont care ” said weston  “what do you people in the rind
care about us  you havent been pulled down yet  its like a dream i
once had  though i didnt know then how true it was  i dreamed i was
lying dead—you know  nicely laid out in the ward in a nursing home with
my face settled by the undertaker and big lilies in the room  and then a
sort of a person who was all falling to bits—like a tramp  you know 
only it was himself not his clothes that was coming to pieces—came and
stood at the foot of the bed  just hating me  all right  he said  all
right  you think youre mighty fine with your clean sheet and your shiny
coffin being got ready  i began like that  we all did  just wait and see
what you come down to in the end ”

“really ” said ransom  “i think you might just as well shut up ”

“then theres spiritualism ” said weston  ignoring this suggestion  “i
used to think it all nonsense  but it isnt  its all true  youve
noticed that all  pleasant  accounts of the dead are traditional or
philosophical  what actual experiment discovers is quite different 
ectoplasm—slimy films coming out of a mediums belly and making great 
chaotic  tumbledown faces  automatic writing producing reams of
rubbish ”

“ are  you weston ” said ransom  suddenly turning upon his companion 
the persistent mumbling voice  so articulate that you had to listen to
it and yet so inarticulate that you had to strain your ears to follow
what it said  was beginning to madden him 

“dont be angry ” said the voice  “theres no good being angry with me 
i thought you might be sorry  my god  ransom  its awful  you dont
understand  right down under layers and layers  buried alive  you try to
connect things and cant  they take your head off       and you cant
even look back on what life was like in the rind  because you know it
never did mean anything even from the beginning ”

“what are you ” cried ransom  “how do you know what death is like  god
knows  id help you if i could  but give me the facts  where have you
been these few days ”

“hush ” said the other suddenly  “whats that ”

ransom listened  certainly there did seem to be a new element in the
great concourse of noises with which they were surrounded  at first he
could not define it  the seas were very big now and the wind was strong 
all at once his companion reached out his hand and clutched ransoms
arm 

“oh  my god ” he cried  “oh  ransom  ransom  we shall be killed  killed
and put back under the rind  ransom  you promised to help me  dont let
them get me again ”

“shut up ” said ransom in disgust  for the creature was wailing and
blubbering so that he could hear nothing else  and he wanted very much
to identify the deeper note that had mingled with the piping wind and
roar of water 

“breakers ” said weston  “breakers  you fool  cant you hear  theres a
country over there  theres a rocky coast  look there—no  to your right 
we shall be smashed into a jelly  look—o god  here comes the dark ”

and the dark came  horror of death such as he had never known  horror of
the terrified creature at his side  descended upon ransom  finally 
horror with no definite object  in a few minutes he could see through
the jet-black night the luminous cloud of foam  from the way in which it
shot steeply upward he judged it was breaking on cliffs  invisible
birds  with a shriek and flurry  passed low overhead 

“are you there  weston ” he shouted  “what cheer  pull yourself
together  all that stuff youve been talking is lunacy  say a childs
prayer if you cant say a mans  repent your sins  take my hand  there
are hundreds of mere boys on earth facing death this moment  well do
very well ”

his hand was clutched in the darkness  rather more firmly than he
wished  “i cant bear it  i cant bear it ” came westons voice 

“steady now  none of that ” he shouted back  for weston had suddenly
gripped his arm with both hands 

“i cant bear it ” came the voice again 

“hi ” said ransom  “let go  what the devil are you doing ”—and as he
spoke strong arms had plucked him from the saddle  had wrapped him round
in a terrible embrace just below his thighs  and  clutching uselessly at
the smooth surface of the fishs body  he was dragged down  the waters
closed over his head  and still his enemy pulled him down into the warm
depth  and down farther yet to where it was no longer warm 




                                fourteen


“i cant hold my breath any longer ” thought ransom  “i cant  i cant ”
cold slimy things slid upwards over his agonised body  he decided to
stop holding his breath  to open his mouth and die  but his will did not
obey this decision  not only his chest but his temples felt as if they
were going to burst  it was idle to struggle  his arms met no adversary
and his legs were pinioned  he became aware that they were moving
upwards  but this gave him no hope  the surface was too far away  he
could not hold out till they reached it  in the immediate presence of
death all ideas of the after life were withdrawn from his mind  the mere
abstract proposition  “this is a man dying” floated before him in an
unemotional way  suddenly a roar of sound rushed back upon his
ears—intolerable boomings and clangings  his mouth opened automatically 
he was breathing again  in a pitch darkness full of echoes he was
clutching what seemed to be gravel and kicking wildly to throw off the
grip that still held his legs  then he was free and fighting once more 
a blind struggle half in and half out of the water on what seemed to be
a pebbly beach  with sharper rocks here and there that cut his feet and
elbows  the blackness was filled with gasping curses  now in his own
voice  now in westons  with yelps of pain  thudding concussions  and
the noise of laboured breath  in the end he was astride of the enemy  he
pressed its sides between his knees till its ribs cracked and clasped
his hands round its throat  somehow he was able to resist its fierce
tearing at his arms—to keep on pressing  once before he had had to press
like this  but that had been on an artery  to save life  not to kill  it
seemed to last for ages  long after the creatures struggles had ceased
he did not dare to relax his grip  even when he was quite sure that it
breathed no longer he retained his seat on its chest and kept his tired
hands  though now loosely  on its throat  he was nearly fainting
himself  but he counted a thousand before he would shift his posture 
even then he continued to sit on its body  he did not know whether in
the last few hours the spirit which had spoken to him was really
westons or whether he had been the victim of a ruse  indeed  it made
little difference  there was  no doubt  a confusion of persons in
damnation  what pantheists falsely hoped of heaven bad men really
received in hell  they were melted down into their master  as a lead
soldier slips down and loses his shape in the ladle held over the gas
ring  the question whether satan  or one whom satan has digested  is
acting on any given occasion  has in the long run no clear significance 
in the meantime  the great thing was not to be tricked again 

there was nothing to be done  then  except to wait for the morning  from
the roar of echoes all about him he concluded that they were in a very
narrow bay between cliffs  how they had ever made it was a mystery  the
morning must be many hours distant  this was a considerable nuisance  he
determined not to leave the body till he had examined it by daylight and
perhaps taken further steps to make sure that it could not be
re-animated  till then he must pass the time as best as he could  the
pebbly beach was not very comfortable  and when he tried to lean back he
found a jagged wall  fortunately he was so tired that for a time the
mere fact of sitting still contented him  but this phase passed 

he tried to make the best of it  he determined to give up guessing how
the time was going  “the only safe answer ” he told himself  “is to
think of the earliest hour you can suppose possible  and then assume the
real time is two hours earlier than that ” he beguiled himself by
recapitulating the whole story of his adventure in perelandra  he
recited all that he could remember of the  iliad   the  odyssey   the
 æneid   the  chanson de roland    paradise lost   the  kalevala   the
 hunting of the snark   and a rhyme about germanic sound-laws which he
had composed as a freshman  he tried to spend as long as he could
hunting for the lines he could not remember  he set himself a chess
problem  he tried to rough out a chapter for a book he was writing  but
it was all rather a failure 

these things went on  alternating with periods of dogged inactivity 
until it seemed to him that he could hardly remember a time before that
night  he could scarcely believe that even to a bored and wakeful man
twelve hours could appear so long  and the noise—the gritty  slippery
discomfort  it was very odd  now he came to think of it  that this
country should have none of those sweet night breezes which he had met
everywhere else in perelandra  it was odd too  but this thought came to
him what seemed hours later  that he had not even the phosphorescent
wave-crests to feed his eyes on  very slowly a possible explanation of
both facts dawned upon him  and it would also explain why the darkness
lasted so long  the idea was too terrible for any indulgence of fear 
controlling himself  he rose stiffly to his feet and began picking his
steps along the beach  his progress was very slow  but presently his
outstretched arms touched perpendicular rock  he stood on tiptoe and
stretched his hands up as far as he could  they found nothing but rock 
“dont get the wind up ” he said to himself  he started groping his way
back  he came to the un-mans body  passed it  and went beyond it round
the opposite beach  it curved rapidly  and here  before he had gone
twenty steps his hands—which he was holding above his head—met  not a
wall  but a roof  of rock  a few paces farther and it was lower  then he
had to stoop  a little later and he had to go on his hands and knees  it
was obvious that the roof came down and finally met the beach 

sick with despair he felt his way back to the body and sat down  the
truth was now beyond doubt  there was no good waiting for the morning 
there would be no morning here till the end of the world  and perhaps he
had already waited a night and a day  the clanging echoes  the dead air 
the very smell of the place  all confirmed this  he and his enemy when
they sank had clearly  by some hundredth chance  been carried through a
hole in the cliffs well below water-level and come up on the beach of a
cavern  was it possible to reverse the process  he went down to the
waters edge—or rather as he groped his way down to where the shingle
was wet  the water came to meet him  it thundered over his head and far
up behind him  and then receded with a tug which he only resisted by
spread-eagling himself on the beach and gripping the stones  it would be
useless to plunge into  that —he would merely have his ribs broken
against the opposite wall of the cave  if one had light  and a high
place to dive from  it was just conceivable one might get down to the
bottom and strike the exit       but very doubtful  and anyway  one had
no light 

although the air was not very good he supposed that his prison must be
supplied with air from somewhere—but whether from any aperture that he
could possibly reach was another matter  he turned at once and began
exploring the rock behind the beach  at first it seemed hopeless  but
the conviction that caves may lead you anywhere dies hard  and after
some time his groping hands found a shelf about three feet high  he
stepped up on it  he had expected it to be only a few inches deep but
his hands could find no wall before him  very cautiously he took some
paces forward  his right foot touched something sharp  he whistled with
the pain and went on even more cautiously  then he found vertical
rock—smooth as high as he could reach  he turned to his right and
presently lost it  he turned left and began to go forward again and
almost at once stubbed his toe  after nursing it for a moment he went
down on hands and knees  he seemed to be among boulders  but the way was
practicable  for ten minutes or so he made fairly good going  pretty
steeply upward  sometimes on slippery shingle  sometimes over the tops
of the big stones  then he came to another cliff  there appeared to be a
shelf on this about four feet up  but this time a really shallow one  he
got on to it somehow and glued himself to the face  feeling out to left
and right for further grips 

when he found one and realised that he was now about to attempt some
real climbing  he hesitated  he remembered that what was above him might
be a cliff which even in daylight and properly clothed he would never
dare to attempt  but hope whispered that it might equally well be only
seven feet high and that a few minutes of coolness might bring him into
those gently winding passages up into the heart of the mountain which
had  by now  won such a firm place in his imagination  he decided to go
on  what worried him was not  in fact  the fear of falling  but the fear
of cutting himself off from the water  starvation he thought he could
face  not thirst  but he went on  for some minutes he did things which
he had never done on earth  doubtless he was in one way helped by the
darkness  he had no real sensation of height and no giddiness  on the
other hand  to work by touch alone made crazy climbing  doubtless if
anyone had seen him he would have appeared at one moment to take mad
risks and at another to indulge in excessive caution  he tried to keep
out of his mind the possibility that he might be climbing merely towards
a roof 

after about quarter of an hour he found himself on a wide horizontal
surface—either a much deeper shelf or the top of the precipice  he
rested here for a while and licked his cuts  then he got up and felt his
way forwards  expecting every moment to meet another rock wall  when 
after about thirty paces  he had not done so  he tried shouting and
judged from the sound that he was in a fairly open place  then he
continued  the floor was of small pebble and ascended fairly steeply 
there were some larger stones but he had learned to curl up his toes as
his foot felt for the next pace and he seldom stubbed them now  one
minor trouble was that even in this perfect blackness he could not help
straining his eyes to see  it gave him a headache and created phantom
lights and colours 

this slow uphill trek through darkness lasted so long that he began to
fear he was going round in a circle  or that he had blundered into some
gallery which ran on for ever beneath the surface of the planet  the
steady ascent in some degree reassured him  the starvation for light
became very painful  he found himself thinking about light as a hungry
man thinks about food—picturing april hillsides with milky clouds racing
over them in blue skies or quiet circles of lamp-light on tables
pleasantly littered with books and pipes  by a curious confusion of mind
he found it impossible not to imagine that the slope he walked on was
not merely dark  but black in its own right  as if with soot  he felt
that his feet and hands must be blackened by touching it  whenever he
pictured himself arriving at any light  he also pictured that light
revealing a world of soot all around him 

he struck his head sharply against something and sat down half stunned 
when he had collected himself he found by groping that the shingle slope
had run up into a roof of smooth rock  his heart was very low as he sat
there digesting this discovery  the sound of the waves came up faint and
melancholy from below and told him that he was now at a great height  at
last  though with very little hope  he began walking to his right 
keeping contact with the roof by raising his arms  presently it receded
beyond his reach  a long time after that he heard a sound of water  he
went on more slowly in great fear of encountering a waterfall  the
shingle began to be wet and finally he stood in a little pool  turning
to his left he found  indeed  a waterfall  but it was a tiny stream with
no force of water that could endanger him  he knelt in the rippling pool
and drank from the fall and put his aching head and weary shoulders
under it  then  greatly refreshed  he tried to work his way up it 

though the stones were slippery with some kind of moss and many of the
pools were deep  it presented no serious difficulties  in about twenty
minutes he had reached the top  and as far as he could judge by shouting
and noticing the echoes he was now in a very large cave indeed  he took
the stream for guidance and proceeded to follow it up  in that
featureless dark it was some sort of company  some real hope—distinct
from that mere convention of hope which supports men in desperate
situations—began to enter his mind 

it was shortly after this that he began to be worried by the noises  the
last faint booming of the sea in the little hole whence he had set out
so many hours ago had now died away and the predominant sound was the
gentle tinkling of the stream  but he now began to think that he heard
other noises mixed with it  sometimes it would be a dull plump as if
something had slipped into one of the pools behind him  sometimes  more
mysteriously  a dry rattling sound as if metal were being dragged over
the stones  at first he put it down to imagination  then he stopped once
or twice to listen and heard nothing  but each time when he went on it
began again  at last  stopping once more  he heard it quite
unmistakably  could it be that the un-man had after all come to life and
was still following him  but that seemed improbable  for its whole plan
had been to escape  it was not so easy to dispose of the other
possibility—that these caverns might have inhabitants  all his
experience  indeed  assured him that if there were such inhabitants they
would probably be harmless  but somehow he could not quite believe that
anything which lived in such a place would be agreeable  and a little
echo of the un-mans—or was it westons—talk came back to him  “all
beautiful on the surface  but down inside—darkness  heat  horror  and
stink ” then it occurred to him that if some creature were following him
up the stream it might be well for him to leave its banks and wait till
the creature had gone past  but if it were hunting him it would
presumably hunt by scent  and in any case he would not risk losing the
stream  in the end he went on 

whether through weakness—for he was now very hungry indeed—or because
the noises behind made him involuntarily quicken his pace  he found
himself unpleasantly hot  and even the stream did not appear very
refreshing when he put his feet in it  he began to think that whether he
were pursued or not he must have a short rest—but just at that moment he
saw the light  his eyes had been mocked so often before that he would
not at first believe it  he shut them while he counted a hundred and
looked again  he turned round and sat down for several minutes  praying
that it might not be a delusion  and looked again  “well ” said ransom 
“if it is a delusion  its a pretty stubborn one ” a very dim  tiny 
quivering luminosity  slightly red in colour  was before him  it was too
weak to illuminate anything else and in that world of blackness he could
not tell whether it was five feet or five miles away  he set out at
once  with beating heart  thank heaven  the stream appeared to be
leading him towards it 

while he thought it was still a long way off he found himself almost
stepping into it  it was a circle of light lying on the surface of the
water  which thereabouts formed a deepish trembling pool  it came from
above  stepping into the pool he looked up  an irregularly shaped patch
of light  now quite distinctly red  was immediately above him  this time
it was strong enough to show him the objects immediately around it  and
when his eyes had mastered them he perceived that he was looking up a
funnel or fissure  its lower aperture lay in the roof of his own cavern
which must here be only a few feet above his head  its upper aperture
was obviously in the floor of a separate and higher chamber whence the
light came  he could see the uneven side of the funnel  dimly
illuminated  and clothed with pads and streamers of a jelly-like and
rather unpleasing vegetation  down this water was trickling and falling
on his head and shoulders in a warm rain  this warmth  together with the
red colour of the light  suggested that the upper cave was illuminated
by subterranean fire  it will not be clear to the reader  and it was not
clear to ransom when he thought about it afterwards  why he immediately
decided to get into the upper cave if he possibly could  what really
moved him  he thinks  was the mere hunger for light  the very first
glance at the funnel restored dimensions and perspective to his world 
and this in itself was like delivery from prison  it seemed to tell him
far more than it actually did of his surroundings  it gave him back that
whole frame of spatial directions without which a man seems hardly able
to call his body his own  after this  any return to the horrible black
vacancy  the world of soot and grime  the world without size or
distance  in which he had been wandering  was out of the question 
perhaps also he had some idea that whatever was following him would
cease to follow if he could get into the lighted cave 

but it was not easy to do  he could not reach the opening of the funnel 
even when he jumped he only just touched the fringe of its vegetation 
at last he hit upon an unlikely plan which was the best he could think
of  there was just enough light here for him to see a number of larger
stones among the gravel  and he set to work to build up a pile in the
centre of the pool  he worked rather feverishly and often had to undo
what he had done  and he tried it several times before it was really
high enough  when at last it was completed and he stood sweating and
shaky on the summit the real hazard was still to be run  he had to grip
the vegetation on each side above his head  trusting to luck that it
would hold  and half jump  half pull himself up as quickly as he could 
since if it held at all it would  he felt sure  not hold for long 
somehow or other he managed it  he got himself wedged into the fissure
with his back against one side and his feet against the other  like a
mountaineer in what is called a chimney  the thick squashy growth
protected his skin  and after a few upward struggles he found the walls
of the passage so irregular that it could be climbed in the ordinary
way  the heat increased rapidly  “im a fool to have come up here ” said
ransom  but even as he said so  he was at the top 

at first he was blinded by the light  when at last he could take in his
surroundings he found himself in a vast hall so filled with firelight
that it gave him the impression of being hollowed out of red clay  he
was looking along the length of it  the floor sloped down to the left
side  on his right it sloped upward to what appeared a cliff edge 
beyond which was an abyss of blinding brightness  a broad shallow river
was flowing down the middle of the cavern  the roof was so high as to be
invisible  but the walls soared up into darkness with broad curves like
the roots of a beech tree 

he staggered to his feet  splashed across the river  which was hot to
the touch  and approached the cliff edge  the fire appeared to be
thousands of feet below him and he could not see the other side of the
pit in which it swelled and roared and writhed  his eyes could only bear
it for a second or so  and when he turned away the rest of the cavern
seemed dark  the heat of his body was painful  he drew away from the
cliff edge and sat down with his back to the fire to collect his
thoughts 

they were collected in an unlooked-for way  suddenly and irresistibly 
like an attack by tanks  that whole view of the universe which weston
 if it were weston  had so lately preached to him  took all but complete
possession of his mind  he seemed to see that he had been living all his
life in a world of illusion  the ghosts  the damned ghosts  were right 
the beauty of perelandra  the innocence of the lady  the sufferings of
saints  and the kindly affections of men  were all only an appearance
and outward show  what he had called the worlds were but the skins of
the worlds  a quarter of a mile beneath the surface  and from thence
through thousands of miles of dark and silence and infernal fire  to the
very heart of each  reality lived—the meaningless  the un-made  the
omnipotent idiocy to which all spirits were irrelevant and before which
all efforts were vain  whatever was following him would come up that
wet  dark hole  would presently be excreted by that hideous duct  and
then he would die  he fixed his eyes upon the dark opening from which he
had himself just emerged  and then—“i thought as much ” said ransom 

slowly  shakily  with unnatural and inhuman movements a human form 
scarlet in the firelight  crawled out on to the floor of the cave  it
was the un-man  of course  dragging its broken leg and with its lower
jaw sagging open like that of a corpse  it raised itself to a standing
position  and then  close behind it  something else came up out of the
hole  first came what looked like branches of trees  and then seven or
eight spots of light  irregularly grouped like a constellation  then a
tubular mass which reflected the red glow as if it were polished  his
heart gave a great leap as the branches suddenly resolved themselves
into long wiry feelers and the dotted lights became the many eyes of a
shell-helmeted head and the mass that followed it was revealed as a
large roughly cylindrical body  horrible things followed—angular  many
jointed legs  and presently  when he thought the whole body was in
sight  a second body came following it and after that a third  the thing
was in three parts  united only by a kind of wasps waist
structure—three parts that did not seem to be truly aligned and made it
look as if it had been trodden on—a huge  many legged  quivering
deformity  standing just behind the un-man so that the horrible shadows
of both danced in enormous and united menace on the wall of rock behind
them 

“they want to frighten me ” said something in ransoms brain  and at the
same moment he became convinced both that the un-man had summoned this
great earth crawler and also that the evil thoughts which had preceded
the appearance of the enemy had been poured into his own mind by the
enemys will  the knowledge that his thoughts could be thus managed from
without did not awake terror but rage  ransom found that he had risen 
that he was approaching the un-man  that he was saying things  perhaps
foolish things  in english  “do you think im going to stand  this  ” he
yelled  “get out of my brain  it isnt yours  i tell you  get out of
it ” as he shouted he had picked up a big  jagged stone from beside the
stream  “ransom ” croaked the un-man  “wait  were both trapped      ”
but ransom was already upon it 

“in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  here
goes—i mean amen ” said ransom  and hurled the stone as hard as he could
into the un-mans face  the un-man fell as a pencil falls  the face
smashed out of all recognition  ransom did not give it a glance but
turned to face the other horror  but where had the horror gone  the
creature was there  a curiously shaped creature no doubt  but all the
loathing had vanished clean out of his mind  so that neither then nor at
any other time could he remember it  nor ever understand again why one
should quarrel with an animal for having more legs or eyes than oneself 
all that he had felt from childhood about insects and reptiles died that
moment  died utterly  as hideous music dies when you switch off the
wireless  apparently it had all  even from the beginning  been a dark
enchantment of the enemys  once  as he had sat writing near an open
window in cambridge  he had looked up and shuddered to see  as he
supposed  a many coloured beetle of unusually hideous shape crawling
across his paper  a second glance showed him that it was a dead leaf 
moved by the breeze  and instantly the very curves and re-entrants which
had made its ugliness turned into its beauties  at this moment he had
almost the same sensation  he saw at once that the creature intended him
no harm—had indeed no intentions at all  it had been drawn thither by
the un-man  and now stood still  tentatively moving its antennæ  then 
apparently not liking its surroundings  it turned laboriously round and
began descending into the hole by which it had come  as he saw the last
section of its tripartite body wobble on the edge of the aperture  and
then finally tip upward with its torpedo-shaped tail in the air  ransom
almost laughed  “like an animated corridor train” was his comment 

he turned to the un-man  it had hardly anything left that you could call
a head  but he thought it better to take no risks  he took it by its
ankles and lugged it up to the edge of the cliff  then  after resting a
few seconds  he shoved it over  he saw its shape black  for a second 
against the sea of fire  and then that was the end of it 

he rolled rather than crawled back to the stream and drank deeply  “this
may be the end of me or it may not ” thought ransom  “there may be a way
out of these caves or there may not  but i wont go another step further
to-day  not if it was to save my life—not to save my life  thats flat 
glory be to god  im tired ” a second later he was asleep 




                                fifteen


for the rest of the subterranean journey after his long sleep in the
firelit cave  ransom was somewhat light-headed with hunger and fatigue 
he remembers lying still after he woke for what seemed many hours and
even debating with himself whether it was worth going on  the actual
moment of decision has vanished from his mind  pictures come back in a
chaotic  disjointed fashion  there was a long gallery open to the
fire-pit on one side and a terrible place where clouds of steam went up
for ever and ever  doubtless one of the many torrents that roared in the
neighbourhood here fell into the depth of the fire  beyond that were
great halls still dimly illuminated and full of unknown mineral wealth
that sparkled and danced in the light and mocked his eyes as if he were
exploring a hall of mirrors by the help of a pocket torch  it seemed to
him also  though this may have been delirium  that he came through a
vast cathedral space which was more like the work of art than that of
nature  with two great thrones at one end and chairs on either hand too
large for human occupants  if the things were real  he never found any
explanation of them  there was a dark tunnel in which a wind from heaven
knows where was blowing and drove sand in his face  there was also a
place where he himself walked in darkness and looked down through fathom
below fathom of shafts and natural arches and winding gulfs on to a
smooth floor lit with a cold green light  and as he stood and looked it
seemed to him that four of the great earth-beetles  dwarfed by distance
to the size of gnats  and crawling two by two  came slowly into sight 
and they were drawing behind them a flat car  and on the car  upright 
unshaken  stood a mantled form  huge and still and slender  and driving
its strange team it passed on with insufferable majesty and went out of
sight  assuredly the inside of this world was not for man  but it was
for something  and it appeared to ransom that there might  if a man
could find it  be some way to renew the old pagan practice of
propitiating the local gods of unknown places in such fashion that it
was no offence to god himself but only a prudent and courteous apology
for trespass  that thing  that swathed form in its chariot  was no doubt
his fellow creature  it did not follow that they were equals or had an
equal right in the under-land  a long time after this came the
drumming—the  boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-boom  out of pitch darkness  distant at
first  then all around him  then dying away after endless prolongation
of echoes in the black labyrinth  then came the fountain of cold light—a
column  as of water  shining with some radiance of its own  and
pulsating  and never any nearer however long he travelled and at last
suddenly eclipsed  he did not find what it was  and so  after more
strangeness and grandeur and labour than i can tell  there came a moment
when his feet slid without warning on clay—a wild grasp—a spasm of
terror—and he was spluttering and struggling in deep  swift-flowing
water  he thought that even if he escaped being battered to death
against the walls of the channel he would presently plunge along with
the stream into the pit of fire  but the channel must have been very
straight and the current perhaps was less violent than he had supposed 
at all events he never touched the sides  he lay helpless  in the end 
rushing forward through echoing darkness  it lasted a long time 

you will understand that what with expectation of death  and weariness 
and the great noise  he was confused in mind  looking back on the
adventure afterwards it seemed to him that he floated out of blackness
into greyness and then into an inexplicable chaos of semi-transparent
blues and greens and whites  there was a hint of arches above his head
and faintly shining columns  but all vague and all obliterating one
another as soon as seen  it looked like a cave of ice  but it was too
warm for that  and the roof above him seemed to be itself rippling like
water  but this was doubtless a reflection  a moment later and he was
rushed out into broad daylight and air and warmth  and rolled head over
heels  and deposited  dazzled and breathless  in the shallows of a great
pool 

he was now almost too weak to move  something in the air  and the wide
silence which made a background to the lonely crying of birds  told him
that he was on a high mountain top  he rolled rather than crawled out of
the pool on to sweet blue turf  looking back whence he had come he saw a
river pouring from the mouth of a cave  a cave that seemed indeed to be
made of ice  under it the water was spectral blue  but near where he lay
it was warm amber  there was mist and freshness and dew all about him 
at his side rose a cliff mantled with streamers of bright vegetation 
but gleaming like glass where its own surface showed through  but this
he heeded little  there were rich clusters of a grape-like fruit glowing
under the little pointed leaves  and he could reach them without getting
up  eating passed into sleeping by a transition he could never remember 

at this point it becomes increasingly difficult to give ransoms
experiences in any certain order  how long he lay beside the river at
the cavern mouth eating and sleeping and waking only to eat and sleep
again  he has no idea  he thinks it was only a day or two  but from the
state of his body when this period of convalescence ended i should
imagine it must have been more like a fortnight or three weeks  it was a
time to be remembered only in dreams as we remember infancy  indeed it
was a second infancy  in which he was breast-fed by the planet venus
herself  unweaned till he moved from that place  three impressions of
this long sabbath remain  one is the endless sound of rejoicing water 
another is the delicious life that he sucked from the clusters which
almost seemed to bow themselves unasked into his upstretched hands  the
third is the song  now high in air above him  now welling up as if from
glens and valleys far below  it floated through his sleep and was the
first sound at every waking  it was formless as the song of a bird  yet
it was not a birds voice  as a birds voice is to a flute  so this was
to a cello  low and ripe and tender  full-bellied  rich and
golden-brown  passionate too  but not with the passions of men 

because he was weaned so gradually from this state of rest i cannot give
his impressions of the place he lay in  bit by bit  as he came to take
it in  but when he was cured and his mind was clear again  this was what
he saw  the cliffs out of which his river had broken through the cave
were not of ice  but of some kind of translucent rock  any little
splinter broken off them was as transparent as glass  but the cliffs
themselves  when you looked at them close  seemed to become opaque about
six inches from the surface  if you waded up-stream into the cave and
then turned back and looked towards the light  the edges of the arch
which formed the caves mouth were distinctly transparent  and
everything looked blue inside the cave  he did not know what happened at
the top of these cliffs 

before him the lawn of blue turf continued level for about thirty paces 
and then dropped with a steep slope  leading the river down in a series
of cataracts  the slope was covered with flowers which shook continually
in a light breeze  it went down a long way and ended in a winding and
wooded valley which curled out of sight on his right hand round a
majestic slope  but beyond that  lower down—so much lower down as to be
almost incredible—one caught the point of mountain tops  and beyond
that  fainter yet  the hint of still lower valleys  and then a vanishing
of everything in golden haze  on the opposite side of this valley the
earth leaped up in great sweeps and folds of almost himalayan height to
the red rocks  they were not red like devonshire cliffs  they were true
rose-red  as if they had been painted  their brightness astonished him 
and so did the needle-like sharpness of their spires  until it occurred
to him that he was in a young world and that these mountains might 
geologically speaking  be in their infancy  also  they might be farther
off than they looked 

to his left and behind him the crystal cliffs shut off his view  to his
right they soon ended and beyond them the ground rose to another and
nearer peak—a much lower one than those he saw across the valley  the
fantastic steepness of all the slopes confirmed his idea that he was on
a very young mountain 

except for the song it was all very still  when he saw birds flying they
were usually a long way below him  on the slopes to his right and  less
distinctly  on the slope of the great  massif  which faced him  there
was a continual tippling effect which he could not account for  it was
like water flowing  but since  if it were a stream on the remoter
mountain  it would have to be a stream two or three miles wide  this
seemed improbable 

in trying to put the completed picture together i have omitted something
which  in fact  made it a long job for ransom to get that picture  the
whole place was subject to mists  it kept on vanishing in a veil of
saffron or very pale gold and reappearing again—almost as if the golden
sky-roof  which indeed looked only a few feet above the mountain-tops 
were opening and pouring down riches upon the world 

day by day as he came to know more of the place  ransom also came to
know more of the state of his own body  for a long time he was too stiff
almost to move and even an incautious breath made him wince  it healed 
however  surprisingly quickly  but just as a man who has had a fall only
discovers the real hurt when the minor bruises and cuts are less
painful  so ransom was nearly well before he detected his most serious
injury  it was a wound in his heel  the shape made it quite clear that
the wound had been inflicted by human teeth—the nasty  blunt teeth of
our own species which crush and grind more than they cut  oddly enough 
he had no recollection of this particular bite in any of his innumerable
tussles with the un-man  it did not look unhealthy  but it was still
bleeding  it was not bleeding at all fast  but nothing he could do would
stop it  but he worried very little about this  neither the future nor
the past really concerned him at this period  wishing and fearing were
modes of consciousness for which he seemed to have lost the faculty 

nevertheless there came a day when he felt the need of some activity and
yet did not feel ready to leave the little lair between the pool and the
cliff which had become like a home  he employed that day in doing
something which may appear rather foolish and yet at the time it seemed
to him that he could hardly omit it  he had discovered that the
substance of the translucent cliffs was not very hard  now he took a
sharp stone of a different kind  and cleared a wide space on the cliff
wall of vegetation  then he made measurements and spaced it all out
carefully and after a few hours had produced the following  the language
was old solar but the letters were roman 

                     within these caves was burned
                                the body
                                   of
                          edward rolles weston
         a learned hnau of the world which those who inhabit it
                              call tellus
                             but the eldila
                               thulcandra
                 he was born when tellus had completed
         one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six revolutions
                              about arbol
                          since the time when
                                maleldil
                             blessed be he
                    was born as a hnau in thulcandra
                  he studied the properties of bodies
           and first of the tellurians travelled through deep
                          heaven to malacandra
                           and to perelandra
                  where he gave up his will and reason
                           to the bent eldil
                         when tellus was making
           the one thousandth nine hundredth and forty-second
                 revolution after the birth of maleldil
                             blessed be he 

“that was a tomfool thing to do ” said ransom to himself contentedly as
he lay down again  “no one will ever read it  but there ought to be some
record  he was a great physicist after all  anyway  it has given me some
exercise ” he yawned prodigiously and settled down to yet another twelve
hours of sleep 

the next day he was better and began taking little walks  not going down
but strolling to and fro on the hillside on each side of the cave  the
following day he was better still  but on the third day he was well  and
ready for adventures 

he set out very early in the morning and began to follow the watercourse
down the hill  the slope was very steep but there were no outcroppings
of rock and the turf was soft and springy and to his surprise he found
that the descent brought no weariness to his knees  when he had been
going about half an hour and the peaks of the opposite mountain were now
too high to see and the crystal cliffs behind him were only a distant
glare  he came to a new kind of vegetation  he was approaching a forest
of little trees whose trunks were only about two and a half feet high 
but from the top of each trunk there grew long streamers which did not
rise in the air but flowed in the wind downhill and parallel to the
ground  thus  when he went in among them  he found himself wading knee
deep and more in a continually rippling sea of them—a sea which
presently tossed all about him as far as his eye could reach  it was
blue in colour  but far lighter than the blue of the turf—almost a
cambridge blue at the centre of each streamer  but dying away at their
tasselled and feathery edges into a delicacy of bluish grey which it
would take the subtlest effects of smoke and cloud to rival in our
world  the soft  almost impalpable  caresses of the long thin leaves on
his flesh  the low  singing  rustling  whispering music  and the frolic
movement all about him  began to set his heart beating with that almost
formidable sense of delight which he had felt before in perelandra  he
realised that these dwarf forests—these ripple-trees as he now
christened them—were the explanation of that water-like movement he had
seen on the farther slopes 

when he was tired he sat down and found himself at once in a new world 
the streamers now flowed above his head  he was in a forest made for
dwarfs  a forest with a blue transparent roof  continually moving and
casting an endless dance of lights and shades upon its mossy floor  and
presently he saw that it was indeed made for dwarfs  through the moss 
which here was of extraordinary fineness  he saw the hithering and
thithering of what at first he took for insects but what proved  on
closer inspection  to be tiny mammals  there were many mountain mice 
exquisite scale models of those he had seen on the forbidden island 
each about the size of a bumble bee  there were little miracles of grace
which looked more like horses than anything he had yet seen on this
world  though they resembled proto-hippos rather than his modern
representative 

“how can i avoid treading on thousands of these ” he wondered  but they
were not really very numerous and the main crowd of them seemed to be
all moving away on his left  when he made to rise he noticed that there
were already very few of them in sight 

he continued to wade down through the rippling streamers  it was like a
sort of vegetable surf-bathing  for about an hour longer  then he came
into woods and presently to a river with a rocky course flowing across
his path to the right  he had  in fact  reached the wooded valley  and
knew that the ground which sloped upwards through trees on the far side
of the water was the beginning of the great ascent  here was amber shade
and solemn height under the forest roof  and rocks wet with cataracts 
and  over all  the noise of that deep singing  it was so loud now and so
full of melody that he went down-stream  a little out of his way  to
look for its origin  this brought him almost at once out of stately
aisles and open glades into a different kind of wood  soon he was
pressing his way through thornless thickets  all in bloom  his head was
covered with the petals that showered on it  his sides gilded with
pollen  much that his fingers touched was gummy and at each pace his
contact with soil and bush appeared to wake new odours that darted into
his brain and there begot wild and enormous pleasures  the noise was
very loud now and the thicket very dense so that he could not see a yard
ahead  when the music stopped suddenly  there was a sound of rustling
and broken twigs and he made hastily in that direction  but found
nothing  he had almost decided to give up the search when the song began
again a little farther away  once more he made after it  once more the
creature stopped singing and evaded him  he must have played thus at
hide-and-seek with it for the best part of an hour before his search was
rewarded 

treading delicately during one of the loudest bursts of music he at last
saw through the flowery branches a black something  standing still
whenever it stopped singing  and advancing with great caution whenever
it began again  he stalked it for ten minutes  at last it was in full
view  and singing  and ignorant that it was watched  it sat upright like
a dog  black and sleek and shiny  but its shoulders were high above
ransoms head  and the forelegs on which they were pillared were like
young trees and the wide soft pads on which they rested were large as
those of a camel  the enormous rounded belly was white  and far up above
the shoulders the neck rose like that of a horse  the head was in
profile from where ransom stood—the mouth wide open as it sang of joy in
thick-coming trills  and the music almost visibly rippled in its glossy
throat  he stared in wonder at the wide liquid eyes and the quivering 
sensitive nostrils  then the creature stopped  saw him  and darted away 
and stood  now a few paces distant  on all four legs  not much smaller
than a young elephant  swaying a long bushy tail  it was the first thing
in perelandra which seemed to show any fear of man  yet it was not fear 
when he called to it it came nearer  it put its velvet nose into his
hand and endured his touch  but almost at once it darted back and 
bending its long neck  buried its head in its paws  he could make no
headway with it  and when at length it retreated out of sight he did not
follow it  to do so would have seemed an injury to its fawn-like
shyness  to the yielding softness of its expression  its evident wish to
be for ever a sound and only a sound in the thickest centre of
untravelled woods  he resumed his journey  a few seconds later the song
broke out behind him  louder and lovelier than before  as if in a pæan
of rejoicing at its recovered privacy 

ransom now addressed himself seriously to the ascent of the great
mountain and in a few minutes emerged from the woods on to its lower
slopes  he continued ascending so steeply that he used hands as well as
feet for about half an hour and was puzzled to find himself doing it
with almost no fatigue  then he came once more into a region of
ripple-trees  this time the wind was blowing the streamers not down the
mountain-side but up it  so that his course had to the eye the
astonishing appearance of lying through a wide blue waterfall which
flowed the wrong way  curving and foaming towards the heights  whenever
the wind failed for a second or two the extreme ends of the streamers
began to curl back under the influence of gravitation  so that it looked
as if the heads of the waves were being flung back by a high wind  he
continued going up through this for a long time  never feeling any real
need for rest but resting occasionally none the less  he was now so high
that the crystal cliffs from which he had set out appeared on a level
with him as he looked back across the valley  he now saw that the land
leaped up beyond them into a whole waste of the same translucent
formation which ended in a kind of glassy tableland  under the naked sun
of our own planet this would have been too bright to look at  here  it
was a tremulous dazzle changing every moment under the undulations which
the perelandrian sky receives from the ocean  to the left of this
tableland were some peaks of greenish rock  he went on  little by little
the peaks and the tableland sank and grew smaller  and presently there
arose beyond them an exquisite haze like vaporised amethyst and emerald
and gold  and the edge of this haze rose as he rose  and became at last
the horizon of the sea  high lifted above the hills  and the sea grew
ever larger and the mountains less  and the horizon of the sea rose and
rose till all the lower mountains behind him seemed to be lying at the
bottom of a great bowl of sea  but ahead  the interminable slope  now
blue  now violet  now flickering with the smoke-like upward movement of
the ripple-trees  soared up and up to the sky  and now the wooded valley
in which he had met the singing beast was invisible and the mountain
from which he had set out looked no more than a little swell on the
slope of the great mountain  and there was not a bird in the air  nor
any creature underneath the streamers  and still he went on unwearied 
but always bleeding a little from his heel  he was not lonely nor
afraid  he had no desires and did not even think about reaching the top
nor why he should reach it  to be always climbing this was not  in his
present mood  a process but a state  and in that state of life he was
content  it did once cross his mind that he had died and felt no
weariness because he had no body  the wound in his heel convinced him
that this was not so  but if it had been so indeed  and these had been
trans-mortal mountains  his journey could hardly have been more great
and strange 

that night he lay on the slopes between the stems of the ripple-trees
with the sweet-scented  wind-proof  delicately-whispering roof above his
head  and when morning came he resumed his journey  at first he climbed
through dense mists  when these parted  he found himself so high that
the concave of the sea seemed to close him in on every side but one  and
on that one he saw the rose-red peaks  no longer very distant  and a
pass between the two nearest ones through which he caught a glimpse of
something soft and flushed  and now he began to feel a strange mixture
of sensations—a sense of perfect duty to enter that secret place which
the peaks were guarding combined with an equal sense of trespass  he
dared not go up that pass  he dared not do otherwise  he looked to see
an angel with a flaming sword  he knew that maleldil bade him go on 
“this is the holiest and the most unholy thing i have ever done ” he
thought  but he went on  and now he was right in the pass  the peaks on
either hand were not of red rock  cores of rock they must have had  but
what he saw were great matterhorns clothed in flowers—a flower shaped
something like a lily but tinted like a rose  and soon the ground on
which he trod was carpeted with the same flowers and he must crush them
as he walked  and here at last his bleeding left no visible trace 

from the neck between the two peaks he looked a little down  for the top
of the mountain was a shallow cup  he saw a valley  a few acres in size 
as secret as a valley in the top of a cloud  a valley pure rose-red 
with ten or twelve of the glowing peaks about it  and in the centre a
pool  married in pure unrippled clearness to the gold of the sky  the
lilies came down to its very edge and lined all its bays and headlands 
yielding without resistance to the awe which was gaining upon him  he
walked forward with slow paces and bowed head  there was something white
near the waters edge  an altar  a patch of white lilies among the red 
a tomb  but whose tomb  no  it was not a tomb but a coffin  open and
empty  and its lid lying beside it 

then of course he understood  this thing was own brother to the
coffin-like chariot in which the strength of angels had brought him from
earth to venus  it was prepared for his return  if he had said  “it is
for my burial ” his feelings would not have been very different  and
while he thought of this he became gradually aware that there was
something odd about the flowers at two places in his immediate
neighbourhood  next  he perceived that the oddity was an oddity in the
light  thirdly  that it was in the air as well as on the ground  then 
as the blood pricked his veins and a familiar  yet strange  sense of
diminished being possessed him  he knew that he was in the presence of
two eldila  he stood still  it was not for him to speak 




                                sixteen


a clear voice like a chime of remote bells  a voice with no blood in it 
spoke out of the air and sent a tingling through his frame 

“they have already set foot on the sand and are beginning to ascend ” it
said 

“the small one from thulcandra is already here ” said a second voice 

“look on him  beloved  and love him ” said the first  “he is indeed but
breathing dust and a careless touch would unmake him  and in his best
thoughts there are such things mingled as  if we thought them  our light
would perish  but he is in the body of maleldil and his sins are
forgiven  his very name in his own tongue is elwin  the friend of the
eldila ”

“how great is your knowledge ” said the second voice 

“i have been down into the air of thulcandra ” said the first  “which
the small ones call tellus  a thickened air as full of the darkened as
deep heaven is of the light ones  i have heard the prisoners there
talking in their divided tongues and elwin has taught me how it is with
them ”

from these words ransom knew the speaker was the oyarsa of malacandra 
the great archon of mars  he did not  of course  recognise the voice 
for there is no difference between one eldils voice and anothers  it
is by art  not nature  that they affect human ear-drums and their words
owe nothing to lungs or lips 

“if it is good  oyarsa ” said ransom  “tell me who is this other ”

“it is oyarsa ” said oyarsa  “and here that is not my name  in my own
sphere i am oyarsa  here i am only malacandra ”

“i am perelandra ” said the other voice 

“i do not understand ” said ransom  “the woman told me there were no
eldila in this world ”

“they have not seen my face till to-day ” said the second voice  “except
as they see it in the water and the roof-heaven  the islands  the caves 
and the trees  i was not set to rule them  but while they were young i
ruled all else  i rounded this ball when it first arose from arbol  i
spun the air about it and wove the roof  i built the fixed island and
this  the holy mountain  as maleldil taught me  the beasts that sing and
the beasts that fly and all that swims on my breast and all that creeps
and tunnels within me down to the centre has been mine  and to-day all
this is taken from me  blessed be he ”

“the small one will not understand you ” said the lord of malacandra 
“he will think that this is a grievous thing in your eyes ”

“he does not say this  malacandra ”

“no  that is another strange thing about the children of adam ”

there was a moments silence and then malacandra addressed ransom  “you
will think of this best if you think of it in the likeness of certain
things from your own world ”

“i think i understand ” said ransom  “for one of maleldils sayers has
told us  it is like when the children of a great house come to their
full age  then those who administered all their riches  and whom perhaps
they have never seen  come and put all in their hands and give up their
keys ”

“you understand well ” said perelandra  “or like when the singing beast
leaves the dumb dam who suckled him ”

“the singing beast ” said ransom  “i would gladly hear more of this ”

“the beasts of that kind have no milk and always what they bring forth
is suckled by the she-beast of another kind  she is great and beautiful
and dumb  and till the young singing beast is weaned it is among her
whelps and is subject to her  but when it is grown it becomes the most
delicate and glorious of all beasts and goes from her  and she wonders
at its song ”

“why has maleldil made such a thing ” said ransom 

“that is to ask why maleldil has made me ” said perelandra  “but now it
is enough to say that from the habits of these two beasts much wisdom
will come into the minds of my king and my queen and their children  but
the hour is upon us  and this is enough ”

“what hour ” asked ransom 

“to-day is the morning day ” said one or other or both the voices  but
there was something much more than sound about ransom and his heart
began beating fast 

“the morning       do you mean       ” he asked  “is all well  has the
queen found the king ”

“the world is born to-day ” said malacandra  “to-day for the first time
two creatures of the low worlds  two images of maleldil that breathe and
breed like the beasts  step up that step at which your parents fell  and
sit in the throne of what they were meant to be  it was never seen
before  because it did not happen in your world a greater thing
happened  but not this  because the greater thing happened in
thulcandra  this and not the greater thing happens here ”

“elwin is falling to the ground ” said the other voice 

“be comforted ” said malacandra  “it is no doing of yours  you are not
great  though you could have prevented a thing so great that deep heaven
sees it with amazement  be comforted  small one  in your smallness  he
lays no merit on you  receive and be glad  have no fear  lest your
shoulders be bearing this world  look  it is beneath your head and
carries you ”

“will they come here ” asked ransom some time later 

“they are already well up the mountains side ” said perelandra  “and
our hour is upon us  let us prepare our shapes  we are hard for them to
see while we remain in ourselves ”

“it is very well said ” answered malacandra  “but in what form shall we
show ourselves to do them honour ”

“let us appear to the small one here ” said the other  “for he is a man
and can tell us what is pleasing to their senses ”

“i can see—i can see  something  even now ” said ransom 

“would you have the king strain his eyes to see those who come to do him
honour ” said the archon of perelandra  “but look on this and tell us
how it deals with you ”

the very faint light—the almost imperceptible alteration in the visual
field—which betokens an eldil vanished suddenly  the rosy peaks and the
calm pool vanished also  a tornado of sheer monstrosities seemed to be
pouring over ransom  darting pillars filled with eyes  lightning
pulsations of flame  talons and beaks and billowy masses of what
suggested snow  volleyed through cubes and heptagons into an infinite
black void  “stop it       stop it ” he yelled  and the scene cleared 
he gazed round blinking on the field of lilies  and presently gave the
eldila to understand that this kind of appearance was not suited to
human sensations  “look then on this ” said the voices again  and he
looked with some reluctance  and far off between the peaks on the other
side of the little valley there came rolling wheels  there was nothing
but that—concentric wheels moving with a rather sickening slowness one
inside the other  there was nothing terrible about them if you could get
used to their appalling size  but there was also nothing significant  he
bade them to try yet a third time  and suddenly two human figures stood
before him on the opposite side of the lake 

they were taller than the sorns  the giants whom he had met in mars 
they were perhaps thirty feet high  they were burning white like
white-hot iron  the outline of their bodies when he looked at it
steadily against the red landscape seemed to be faintly  swiftly
undulating as though the permanence of their shape  like that of
waterfalls or flames  co-existed with a rushing movement of the matter
it contained  for a fraction of an inch inward from this outline the
landscape was just visible through them  beyond that they were opaque 

whenever he looked straight at them they appeared to be rushing towards
him with enormous speed  whenever his eyes took in their surroundings he
realised that they were stationary  this may have been due in part to
the fact that their long and sparkling hair stood out straight behind
them as if in a great wind  but if there were a wind it was not made of
air  for no petal of the flowers was shaken  they were not standing
quite vertically in relation to the floor of the valley  but to ransom
it appeared  as it had appeared to me on earth when i saw one  that the
eldils were vertical  it was the valley—it was the whole world of
perelandra—which was aslant  he remembered the words of oyarsa long ago
in mars  “i am not  here  in the same way that you are  here  ” it was
borne in upon him that the creatures were really moving  though not
moving in relation to him  this planet which inevitably seemed to him
while he was in it an unmoving world— the  world  in fact—was to them a
thing moving through the heavens  in relation to their own celestial
frame of reference they were rushing forward to keep abreast of the
mountain valley  had they stood still  they would have flashed past him
too quickly for him to see  doubly dropped behind by the planets spin
on its own axis and by its onward march around the sun 

their bodies  he said  were white  but a flush of diverse colours began
at about the shoulders and streamed up the necks and flickered over face
and head and stood out around the head like plumage or a halo  he told
me he could in a sense remember these colours—that is  he would know
them if he saw them again—but that he cannot by any effort call up a
visual image of them nor give them any name  the very few people with
whom he and i can discuss these matters all give the same explanation 
we think that when creatures of the hypersomatic kind choose to “appear”
to us  they are not in fact affecting our retina at all  but directly
manipulating the relevant parts of our brain  if so  it is quite
possible that they can produce there the sensations we  should  have if
our eyes were capable of receiving those colours in the spectrum which
are actually beyond their range  the “plumage” or halo of the one eldil
was extremely different from that of the other  the oyarsa of mars shone
with cold and morning colours  a little metallic—pure  hard  and
bracing  the oyarsa of venus glowed with a warm splendour  full of the
suggestion of teeming vegetable life 

the faces surprised him very much  nothing less like the “angel” of
popular art could well be imagined  the rich variety  the hint of
undeveloped possibilities  which make the interest of human faces  were
entirely absent  one single  changeless expression—so clear that it hurt
and dazzled him—was stamped on each and there was nothing else there at
all  in that sense their faces were as “primitive ” as unnatural  if you
like  as those of archaic statues from ægina  what this one thing was he
could not be certain  he concluded in the end that it was charity  but
it was terrifyingly different from the expression of human charity 
which we always see either blossoming out of  or hastening to descend
into  natural affection  here there was no affection at all  no least
lingering memory of it even at ten million years distance  no germ from
which it could spring in any future  however remote  pure  spiritual 
intellectual love shot from their faces like barbed lightning  it was so
unlike the love we experience that its expression could easily be
mistaken for ferocity 

both the bodies were naked  and both were free from any sexual
characteristics  either primary or secondary  that  one would have
expected  but whence came this curious difference between them  he found
that he could point to no single feature wherein the difference resided 
yet it was impossible to ignore  one could try—ransom has tried a
hundred times—to put it into words  he has said that malacandra was like
rhythm and perelandra like melody  he has said that malacandra affected
him like a quantitative  perelandra like an accentual  metre  he thinks
that the first held in his hand something like a spear  but the hands of
the other were open  with the palms towards him  but i dont know that
any of these attempts has helped me much  at all events what ransom saw
at that moment was the real meaning of gender  everyone must sometimes
have wondered why in nearly all tongues certain inanimate objects are
masculine and others feminine  what is masculine about a mountain or
feminine about certain trees  ransom has cured me of believing that this
is a purely morphological phenomenon  depending on the form of the word 
still less is gender an imaginative extension of sex  our ancestors did
not make mountains masculine because they projected male characteristics
into them  the real process is the reverse  gender is a reality  and a
more fundamental reality than sex  sex is  in fact  merely the
adaptation to organic life of a fundamental polarity which divides all
created beings  female sex is simply one of the things that have
feminine gender  there are many others  and masculine and feminine meet
us on planes of reality where male and female would be simply
meaningless  masculine is not attenuated male  nor feminine attenuated
female  on the contrary  the male and female of organic creatures are
rather faint and blurred reflections of masculine and feminine  their
reproductive functions  their differences in strength and size  partly
exhibit  but partly also confuse and misrepresent  the real polarity 
all this ransom saw  as it were  with his own eyes  the two white
creatures were sexless  but he of malacandra was masculine  not male  
she of perelandra was feminine  not female   malacandra seemed to him to
have the look of one standing armed  at the ramparts of his own remote
archaic world  in ceaseless vigilance  his eyes ever roaming the
earth-ward horizon whence his danger came long ago  “a sailors look ”
ransom once said to me  “you know       eyes that are impregnated with
distance ” but the eyes of perelandra opened  as it were  inward  as if
they were the curtained gateway to a world of waves and murmurings and
wandering airs  of life that rocked in winds and splashed on mossy
stones and descended as the dew and arose sunward in thin-spun delicacy
of mist  on mars the very forests are of stone  in venus the lands swim 
for now he thought of them no more as malacandra and perelandra  he
called them by their tellurian names  with deep wonder he thought to
himself  “my eyes have seen mars and venus  i have seen ares and
aphrodite ” he asked them how they were known to the old poets of
tellus  when and from whom had the children of adam learned that ares
was a man of war and that aphrodite rose from the sea foam  earth has
been besieged  an enemy-occupied territory  since before history began 
the gods have had no commerce there  how then do we know of them  it
comes  they told him  a long way round and through many stages  there is
an environment of minds as well as of space  the universe is one—a
spiders web wherein each mind lives along every line  a vast whispering
gallery where  save for the direct action of maleldil  though no news
travels unchanged yet no secret can be rigorously kept  in the mind of
the fallen archon under whom our planet groans  the memory of deep
heaven and the gods with whom he once consorted is still alive  nay  in
the very matter of our world  the traces of the celestial commonwealth
are not quite lost  memory passes through the womb and hovers in the
air  the muse is a real thing  a faint breath  as virgil says  reaches
even the late generations  our mythology is based on a solider reality
than we dream  but it is also at an almost infinite distance from that
base  and when they told him this  ransom at last understood why
mythology was what it was—gleams of celestial strength and beauty
falling on a jungle of filth and imbecility  his cheeks burned on behalf
of our race when he looked on the true mars and venus and remembered the
follies that have been talked of them on earth  then a doubt struck him 

“but do i see you as you really are ” he asked 

“only maleldil sees any creature as it really is ” said mars 

“how do you see one another ” asked ransom 

“there are no holding places in your mind for an answer to that ”

“am i then seeing only an appearance  is it not real at all ”

“you see only an appearance  small one  you have never seen more than an
appearance of anything—not of arbol  nor of a stone  nor of your own
body  this appearance is as true as what you see of those ”

“but       there were those other appearances ”

“no  there was only the failure of appearance ”

“i dont understand ” said ransom  “were all those other things—the
wheels and the eyes—more real than this or less ”

“there is no meaning in your question ” said mars  “you can see a stone 
if it is a fit distance from you and if you and it are moving at speeds
not too different  but if one throws the stone at your eye  what then is
the appearance ”

“i should feel pain and perhaps see splintered light ” said ransom  “but
i dont know that i should call that an appearance of the stone ”

“yet it would be the true operation of the stone  and there is your
question answered  we are now at the right distance from you ”

“and were you nearer in what i first saw ”

“i do not mean that kind of distance ”

“and then ” said ransom  still pondering  “there is what i had thought
was your wonted appearance—the very faint light  oyarsa  as i used to
see it in your own world  what of that ”

“that is enough appearance for us to speak to you by  no more was needed
between us  no more is needed now  it is to honour the king that we
would now appear more  that light is the overflow or echo into the world
of your senses of vehicles made for appearance to one another and to the
greater eldila ”

at this moment ransom suddenly noticed an increasing disturbance of
sound behind his back—of unco-ordinated sound  husky and pattering
noises which broke in on the mountain silence and the crystal voices of
the gods with a delicious note of warm animality  he glanced round 
romping  prancing  fluttering  gliding  crawling  waddling  with every
kind of movement—in every kind of shape and colour and size—a whole zoo
of beasts and birds was pouring into a flowery valley through the passes
between the peaks at his back  they came mostly in their pairs  male and
female together  fawning upon one another  climbing over one another 
diving under one anothers bellies  perching upon one anothers backs 
flaming plumage  gilded beaks  glossy flanks  liquid eyes  great red
caverns of whinneying or of bleating mouths  and thickets of switching
tails  surrounded him on every side  “a regular noahs ark ” thought
ransom  and then  with sudden seriousness  “but there will be no ark
needed in this world ”

the song of four singing beasts rose in almost deafening triumph above
the restless multitude  the great eldil of perelandra kept back the
creatures to the hither side of the pool  leaving the opposite side of
the valley empty except for the coffin-like object  ransom was not clear
whether venus spoke to the beasts or even whether they were conscious of
her presence  her connection with them was perhaps of some subtler
kind—quite different from the relations he had observed between them and
the green lady  both the eldila were now on the same side of the pool
with ransom  he and they and all the beasts were facing in the same
direction  the thing began to arrange itself  first  on the very brink
of the pool  were the eldila  standing  between them  and a little back 
was ransom  still sitting among the lilies  behind him the four singing
beasts  sitting up on their haunches like fire-dogs  and proclaiming joy
to all ears  behind these again  the other animals  the sense of
ceremony deepened  the expectation became intense  in our foolish human
fashion he asked a question merely for the purpose of breaking it  “how
can they climb to here and go down again and yet be off this island
before nightfall ” nobody answered him  he did not need an answer  for
somehow he knew perfectly well that  this  island had never been
forbidden them  and that one purpose in forbidding the other had been to
lead them to this their destined throne  instead of answering  the gods
said  “be still ”

ransoms eyes had grown so used to the tinted softness of perelandrian
daylight—and specially since his journey in the dark guts of the
mountain—that he had quite ceased to notice its difference from the
daylight of our own world  it was  therefore  with a shock of double
amazement that he now suddenly saw the peaks on the far side of the
valley showing really dark against what seemed a terrestrial dawn  a
moment later sharp  well-defined shadows—long  like the shadows at early
morning—were streaming back from every beast and every unevenness of the
ground and each lily had its light and its dark side  up and up came the
light from the mountain slope  it filled the whole valley  the shadows
disappeared again  all was in a pure daylight that seemed to come from
nowhere in particular  he knew ever afterwards what is meant by a light
“resting on” or “overshadowing” a holy thing  but not emanating from it 
for as the light reached its perfection and settled itself  as it were 
like a lord upon his throne or like wine in a bowl  and filled the whole
flowery cup of the mountain top  every cranny  with its purity  the holy
thing  paradise itself in its two persons  paradise walking hand in
hand  its two bodies shining in the light like emeralds yet not
themselves too bright to look at  came in sight in the cleft between two
peaks  and stood a moment with its male right hand lifted in regal and
pontificial benediction  and then walked down and stood on the far side
of the water  and the gods kneeled and bowed their huge bodies before
the small forms of that young king and queen 




                               seventeen


there was great silence on the mountain top and ransom also had fallen
down before the human pair  when at last he raised his eyes from the
four blessed feet  he found himself involuntarily speaking though his
voice was broken and his eyes dimmed  “do not move away  do not raise me
up ” he said  “i have never before seen a man or a woman  i have lived
all my life among shadows and broken images  oh  my father and my
mother  my lord and my lady  do not move  do not answer me yet  my own
father and mother i have never seen  take me for your son  we have been
alone in my world for a great time ”

the eyes of the queen looked upon him with love and recognition  but it
was not of the queen that he thought most  it was hard to think of
anything but the king  and how shall i—i who have not seen him—tell you
what he was like  it was hard even for ransom to tell me of the kings
face  but we dare not withhold the truth  it was that face which no man
can say he does not know  you might ask how it was possible to look upon
it and not to commit idolatry  not to mistake it for that of which it
was the likeness  for the resemblance was  in its own fashion  infinite 
so that almost you could wonder at finding no sorrows in his brow and no
wounds in his hands and feet  yet there was no danger of mistaking  not
one moment of confusion  no least sally of the will towards forbidden
reverence  where likeness was greatest  mistake was least possible 
perhaps this is always so  a clever wax-work can be made so like a man
that for a moment it deceives us  the great portrait which is far more
deeply like him does not  plaster images of the holy one may before now
have drawn to themselves the adoration they were meant to arouse for the
reality  but here  where his live image  like him within and without 
made by his own bare hands out of the depth of divine artistry  his
masterpiece of self-portraiture coming forth from his workshop to
delight all worlds  walked and spoke before ransoms eyes  it could
never be taken for more than an image  nay  the very beauty of it lay in
the certainty that it was a copy  like and not the same  an echo  a
rhyme  an exquisite reverberation of the uncreated music prolonged in a
created medium 

ransom was lost for a while in the wonder of these things  so that when
he came to himself he found that perelandra was speaking  and what he
heard seemed to be the end of a long oration  “the floating lands and
the firm lands ” she was saying  “the air and the curtains at the gates
of deep heaven  the seas and the holy mountain  the rivers above and the
rivers of under-land  the fire  the fish  the birds  the beasts  and the
others of the waves whom yet you know not  all these maleldil puts into
your hand from this day forth as far as you live in time and farther  my
word henceforth is nothing  your word is law unchangeable and the very
daughter of the voice  in all that circle which this world runs about
arbol  you are oyarsa  enjoy it well  give names to all creatures  guide
all natures to perfection  strengthen the feebler  lighten the darker 
love all  hail and be glad  oh man and woman  oyarsa-perelendri  the
adam  the crown  tor and tinidril  baru and baruah  ask and embla 
yatsur and yatsurah  dear to maleldil  blessed be he ”

when the king spoke in answer  ransom looked up at him again  he saw
that the human pair were now seated on a low bank that rose near the
margin of the pool  so great was the light  that they cast clear
reflections in the water as they might have done in our own world 

“we give you thanks  fair foster mother ” said the king  “and specially
for this world in which you have laboured for long ages as maleldils
very hand that all might be ready for us when we woke  we have not known
you till to-day  we have often wondered whose hand it was that we saw in
the long waves and the bright islands and whose breath delighted us in
the wind at morning  for though we were young then  we saw dimly that to
say it is maleldil was true  but not all the truth  this world we
receive  our joy is the greater because we take it by your gift as well
as by his  but what does he put into your mind to do henceforward ”

“it lies in your bidding  tor-oyarsa ” said perelandra  “whether i now
converse in deep heaven only or also in that part of deep heaven which
is to you a world ”

“it is very much our will ” said the king  “that you remain with us 
both for the love we bear you and also that you may strengthen us with
counsel and even with your operations  not till we have gone many times
about arbol shall we grow up to the full management of the dominion
which maleldil puts into our hands  nor are we yet ripe to steer the
world through heaven nor to make rain and fair weather upon us  if it
seems good to you  remain ”

“i am content ” said perelandra 

while this dialogue proceeded  it was a wonder that the contrast between
the adam and the eldils was not a discord  on the one side  the crystal 
bloodless voice  and the immutable expression of the snow-white face  on
the other the blood coursing in the veins  the feeling trembling on the
lips and sparkling in the eyes  the might of the mans shoulders  the
wonder of the womans breasts  a splendour of virility and richness of
womanhood unknown on earth  a living torrent of perfect animality—yet
when these met  the one did not seem rank nor the other spectral 
 animal rationale —an animal  yet also a reasonable soul  such  he
remembered  was the old definition of man  but he had never till now
seen the reality  for now he saw this living paradise  the lord and
lady  as the resolution of discords  the bridge that spans what would
else be a chasm in creation  the keystone of the whole arch  by entering
that mountain valley they had suddenly united the warm multitude of the
brutes behind him with the transcorporeal intelligences at his side 
they closed the circle  and with their coming all the separate notes of
strength or beauty which that assembly had hitherto struck became one
music  but now the king was speaking again 

“and as it is not maleldils gift simply ” he said  “but also maleldils
gift through you  and thereby the richer  so it is not through you only 
but through a third  and thereby the richer again  and this is the first
word i speak as tor-oyarsa-perelendri  that in our world  as long as it
is a world  neither shall morning come nor night but that we and all our
children shall speak to maleldil of ransom the man of thulcandra and
praise him to one another  and to you  ransom  i say this  that you have
called us lord and father  lady and mother  and rightly  for this is our
name  but in another fashion we call you lord and father  for it seems
to us that maleldil sent you into our world at that day when the time of
our being young drew to its end  and from it we must now go up or go
down  into corruption or into perfection  maleldil has taken us where he
meant us to be  but of maleldils instruments in this  you were the
chief ”

they made him go across the water to them  wading  for it came only to
his knees  he would have fallen at their feet but they would not let
him  they rose to meet him and both kissed him  mouth to mouth and heart
to heart as equals embrace  they would have made him sit between them 
but when they saw that this troubled him they let it be  he went and sat
down on the level ground  below them  and a little to the left  from
there he faced the assembly—the huge shapes of the gods and the
concourse of beasts  and then the queen spoke 

“as soon as you had taken away the evil one ” she said  “and i awoke
from sleep  my mind was cleared  it is a wonder to me  piebald  that for
all those days you and i could have been so young  the reason for not
yet living on the fixed land is now so plain  how could i wish to live
there except because it was fixed  and why should i desire the fixed
except to make sure—to be able on one day to command where i should be
the next and what should happen to me  it was to reject the wave—to draw
my hands out of maleldils  to say to him  not thus  but thus—to put
in our own power what times should roll towards us       as if you
gathered fruits together to-day for to-morrows eating instead of taking
what came  that would have been cold love and feeble trust  and out of
it how could we ever have climbed back into love and trust again ”

“i see it well ” said ransom  “though in my world it would pass for
folly  we have been evil so long”—and then he stopped  doubtful of being
understood and surprised that he had used a word for  evil  which he had
not hitherto known that he knew  and which he had not heard either in
mars or in venus 

“we know these things now ” said the king  seeing ransoms hesitation 
“all this  all that happened in your world  maleldil has put into our
mind  we have learned of evil  though not as the evil one wished us to
learn  we have learned better than that  and know it more  for it is
waking that understands sleep and not sleep that understands waking 
there is an ignorance of evil that comes from being young  there is a
darker ignorance that comes from doing it  as men by sleeping lose the
knowledge of sleep  you are more ignorant of evil in thulcandra now than
in the days before your lord and lady began to do it  but maleldil has
brought us out of the one ignorance  and we have not entered the other 
it was by the evil one himself that he brought us out of the first 
little did that dark mind know the errand on which he really came to
perelandra ”

“forgive me  my father  if i speak foolishly ” said ransom  “i see how
evil has been made known to the queen  but not how it was made known to
you ”

then unexpectedly the king laughed  his body was very big and his laugh
was like an earthquake in it  loud and deep and long  till in the end
ransom laughed too  though he had not seen the joke  and the queen
laughed as well  and the birds began clapping their wings and the beasts
wagging their tails  and the light seemed brighter and the pulse of the
whole assembly quickened  and new modes of joy that had nothing to do
with mirth as we understand it passed into them all  as it were from the
very air  or as if there were dancing in deep heaven  some say there
always is 

“i know what he is thinking ” said the king  looking upon the queen  “he
is thinking that you suffered and strove and i have a world for my
reward ” then he turned to ransom and continued  “you are right ” he
said  “i know now what they say in your world about justice  and perhaps
they say well  for in that world things always fall below justice  but
maleldil always goes above it  all is gift  i am oyarsa not by his gift
alone but by our foster mothers  not by hers alone but by yours  not by
yours alone but my wifes—nay  in some sort  by gift of the very beasts
and birds  through many hands  enriched with many different kinds of
love and labour  the gift comes to me  it is the law  the best fruits
are plucked for each by some hand that is not his own ”

“that is not the whole of what happened  piebald ” said the queen  “the
king has not told you all  maleldil drove him far away into a green sea
where forests grow up from the bottom through the waves       ”

“its name is lur ” said the king 

“its name is lur ” repeated the eldila  and ransom realised that the
king had uttered not an observation but an enactment 

“and there in lur  it is far hence  ” said the queen  “strange things
befell him ”

“is it good to ask about these things ” said ransom 

“there were many things ” said tor the king  “for many hours i learned
the properties of shapes by drawing lines in the turf of a little island
on which i rode  for many hours i learned new things about maleldil and
about his father and the third one  we knew little of this while we were
young  but after that he showed me in a darkness what was happening to
the queen  and i knew it was possible for her to be undone  and then i
saw what had happened in your world  and how your mother fell and how
your father went with her  doing her no good thereby and bringing the
darkness upon all their children  and then it was before me like a thing
coming towards my hand       what i should do in like case  there i
learned of evil and good  of anguish and joy ”

ransom had expected the king to relate his decision  but when the kings
voice died away into thoughtful silence he had not the assurance to
question him 

“yes      ” said the king  musing  “though a man were to be torn in two
halves       though half of him turned into earth        the living half
must still follow maleldil  for if it also lay down and became earth 
what hope would there be for the whole  but while one half lived 
through it he might send life back into the other ” here he paused for a
long time  and then spoke again somewhat quickly  “he gave me no
assurance  no fixed land  always one must throw oneself into the wave ”
then he cleared his brow and turned to the eldila and spoke in a new
voice 

“certainly  oh foster mother ” he said  “we have much need of counsel
for already we feel that growing up within our bodies which our young
wisdom can hardly overtake  they will not always be bodies bound to the
low worlds  hear the second word that i speak as tor-oyarsa-perelendri 
while this world goes about arbol ten thousand times  we shall judge and
hearten our people from this throne  its name is tai harendrimar  the
hill of life ”

“its name is tai harendrimar ” said the eldila 

“on the fixed land which once was forbidden ” said tor the king  “we
will make a great place to the splendour of maleldil  our sons shall
bend the pillars of rock into arches——”

“what are arches ” said tinidril the queen 

“arches” said tor the king  “are when pillars of stone throw out
branches like trees and knit their branches together and bear up a great
dome as of leafage  but the leaves shall be shaped stones  and there our
sons will make images ”

“what are images ” said tinidril 

“splendour of deep heaven ” cried the king with a great laugh  “it seems
there are too many new words in the air  i had thought these things were
coming out of your mind into mine  and lo  you have not thought them at
all  yet i think maleldil passed them to me through you  none the less 
i will show you images  i will show you houses  it may be that in this
matter our natures are reversed and it is you who beget and i who bear 
but let us speak of plainer matters  we will fill this world with our
children  we will know this world to the centre  we will make the nobler
of the beasts so wise that they will become  hnau  and speak  their
lives shall awake to a new life in us as we awake in maleldil  when the
time is ripe for it and the ten thousand circlings are nearly at an end 
we will tear the sky curtain and deep heaven shall become familiar to
the eyes of our sons as the trees and the waves to ours ”

“and what after this  tor-oyarsa ” said malacandra 

“then it is maleldils purpose to make us free of deep heaven  our
bodies will be changed  but not all changed  we shall be as the eldila 
but not all as the eldila  and so will all our sons and daughters be
changed in the time of their ripeness  until the number is made up which
maleldil read in his fathers mind before times flowed ”

“and that ” said ransom  “will be the end ”

tor the king stared at him 

“the end ” he said  “who spoke of an end ”

“the end of your world  i mean ” said ransom 

“splendour of heaven ” said tor  “your thoughts are unlike ours  about
that time we shall be not far from the beginning of all things  but
there will be one matter to settle before the beginning rightly begins ”

“what is that ” asked ransom 

“your own world ” said tor  “thulcandra  the siege of your world shall
be raised  the black spot cleared away  before the real beginning  in
those days maleldil will go to war—in us  and in many who once were
 hnau  on your world  and in many from far off and in many eldila  and 
last of all  in himself unveiled  he will go down to thulcandra  some of
us will go before  it is in my mind  malacandra  that thou and i will be
among those  we shall fall upon your moon  wherein there is a secret
evil  and which is as the shield of the dark lord of thulcandra—scarred
with many a blow  we shall break her  her light shall be put out  her
fragments shall fall into your world and the seas and the smoke shall
arise so that the dwellers in thulcandra will no longer see the light of
arbol  and as maleldil himself draws near  the evil things in your world
shall show themselves stripped of disguise so that plagues and horrors
shall cover your lands and seas  but in the end all shall be cleansed 
and even the memory of your black oyarsa blotted out  and your world
shall be fair and sweet and reunited to the field of arbol and its true
name shall be heard again  but can it be  friend  that no rumour of all
this is heard in thulcandra  do your people think that their dark lord
will hold his prey forever ”

“most of them ” said ransom  “have ceased to think of such things at
all  some of us still have the knowledge  but i did not at once see what
you were talking of  because what you call the beginning we are
accustomed to call the last things ”

“i do not call it the beginning ” said tor the king  “it is but the
wiping out of a false start in order that the world may  then  begin  as
when a man lies down to sleep  if he finds a twisted root under his
shoulder he will change his place—and after that his real sleep begins 
or as a man setting foot on an island  may make a false step  he
steadies himself and after that his journey begins  you would not call
that steadying of himself a last thing ”

“and is the whole story of my race no more than this ” said ransom 

“i see no more than beginnings in the history of the low worlds ” said
tor the king  “and in yours a failure to begin  you talk of evenings
before the day has dawned  i set forth even now on ten thousand years of
preparation—i  the first of my race  my race the first of races  to
begin  i tell you that when the last of my children has ripened and
ripeness has spread from them to all the low worlds  it will be
whispered that the morning is at hand ”

“i am full of doubts and ignorance ” said ransom  “in our world those
who know maleldil at all believe that his coming down to us and being a
man is the central happening of all that happens  if you take that from
me  father  whither will you lead me  surely not to the enemys talk
which thrusts my world and my race into a remote corner and gives me a
universe with no centre at all  but millions of worlds that lead nowhere
or  what is worse  to more and more worlds for ever  and comes over me
with numbers and empty spaces and repetitions and asks me to bow down
before bigness  or do you make your world the centre  but i am troubled 
what of the people on malacandra  would they also think that their world
was the centre  i do not even see how your world can rightly be called
yours  you were made yesterday and it is from of old  the most of it is
water where you cannot live  and what of the things beneath its crust 
and of the great spaces with no world at all  is the enemy easily
answered when he says that all is without plan or meaning  as soon as we
think we see one it melts away into nothing  or into some other plan
that we never dreamed of  and what was the centre becomes the rim  till
we doubt if any shape or plan or pattern was ever more than a trick of
our own eyes  cheated with hope  or tired with too much looking  to what
is all driving  what is the morning you speak of  what is it the
beginning of ”

“the beginning of the great game  of the great dance ” said tor  “i know
little of it as yet  let the eldila speak ”

the voice that spoke next seemed to be that of mars  but ransom was not
certain  and who spoke after that  he does not know at all  for in the
conversation that followed—if it can be called a conversation—though he
believes that he himself was sometimes the speaker  he never knew which
words were his or anothers  or even whether a man or an eldil was
talking  the speeches followed one another—if  indeed  they did not all
take place at the same time—like the parts of a music into which all
five of them had entered as instruments or like a wind blowing through
five trees that stand together on a hilltop 

“we would not talk of it like that ” said the first voice  “the great
dance does not wait to be perfect until the peoples of the low worlds
are gathered into it  we speak not of when it will begin  it has begun
from before always  there was no time when we did not rejoice before his
face as now  the dance which we dance is at the centre and for the dance
all things were made  blessed be he ”

another said  “never did he make two things the same  never did he utter
one word twice  after earths  not better earths but beasts  after
beasts  not better beasts but spirits  after a falling  not recovery but
a new creation  out of the new creation  not a third but the mode of
change itself is changed for ever  blessed be he ”

and another said  “it is loaded with justice as a tree bows down with
fruit  all is righteousness and there is no equality  not as when stones
lie side by side  but as when stones support and are supported in an
arch  such is his order  rule and obedience  begetting and bearing  heat
glancing down  life growing up  blessed be he ”

one said  “they who add years to years in lumpish aggregation  or miles
to miles and galaxies to galaxies  shall not come near his greatness 
the day of the fields of arbol will fade and the days of deep heaven
itself are numbered  not thus is he great  he dwells  all of him dwells 
within the seed of the smallest flower and is not cramped  deep heaven
is inside him who is inside the seed and does not distend him  blessed
be he ”

“the edge of each nature borders on that whereof it contains no shadow
or similitude  of many points one line  of many lines one shape  of many
shapes one solid body  of many senses and thoughts one person  of three
persons  himself  as is the circle to the sphere  so are the ancient
worlds that needed no redemption to that world wherein he was born and
died  as is a point to a line  so is that world to the far-off fruits of
its redeeming  blessed be he ”

“yet the circle is not less round than the sphere  and the sphere is the
home and fatherland of circles  infinite multitudes of circles lie
enclosed in every sphere  and if they spoke they would say  for us were
spheres created  let no mouth open to gainsay them  blessed be he ”

“the peoples of the ancient worlds who never sinned  for whom he never
came down  are the peoples for whose sake the low worlds were made  for
though the healing what was wounded and the straightening what was bent
is a new dimension of glory  yet the straight was not made that it might
be bent nor the whole that it might be wounded  the ancient peoples are
at the centre  blessed be he ”

“all which is not itself the great dance was made in order that he might
come down into it  in the fallen world he prepared for himself a body
and was united with the dust and made it glorious for ever  this is the
end and final cause of all creating  and the sin whereby it came is
called fortunate and the world where this was enacted is the centre of
worlds  blessed be he ”

“the tree was planted in that world but the fruit has ripened in this 
the fountain that sprang with mingled blood and life in the dark world 
flows here with life only  we have passed the first cataracts  and from
here onward the stream flows deep and turns in the direction of the sea 
this is the morning star which he promised to those who conquer  this is
the centre of worlds  till now  all has waited  but now the trumpet has
sounded and the army is on the move  blessed be he ”

“though men or angels rule them  the worlds are for themselves  the
waters you have not floated on  the fruit you have not plucked  the
caves into which you have not descended and the fire through which your
bodies cannot pass  do not await your coming to put on perfection 
though they will obey you when you come  times without number i have
circled arbol while you were not alive  and those times were not desert 
their own voice was in them  not merely a dreaming of the day when you
should awake  they also were at the centre  be comforted  small
immortals  you are not the voice that all things utter  nor is there
eternal silence in the places where you cannot come  no feet have
walked  nor shall  on the ice of glund  no eye looked up from beneath on
the ring of lurga  and iron-plain in neruval is chaste and empty  yet it
is not for nothing that the gods walk ceaselessly around the fields of
arbol  blessed be he ”

“that dust itself which is scattered so rare in heaven  whereof all
worlds  and the bodies that are not worlds  are made  is at the centre 
it waits not till created eyes have seen it or hands handled it  to be
in itself a strength and splendour of maleldil  only the least part has
served  or ever shall  a beast  a man  or a god  but always  and beyond
all distances  before they came and after they are gone and where they
never come  it is what it is and utters the heart of the holy one with
its own voice  it is farthest from him of all things  for it has no
life  nor sense  nor reason  it is nearest to him of all things for
without intervening soul  as sparks fly out of fire  he utters in each
grain of it the unmixed image of his energy  each grain  if it spoke 
would say  i am at the centre  for me all things were made  let no mouth
open to gainsay it  blessed be he ”

“each grain is at the centre  the dust is at the centre  the worlds are
at the centre  the beasts are at the centre  the ancient peoples are
there  the race that sinned is there  tor and tinidril are there  the
gods are there also  blessed be he ”

“where maleldil is  there is the centre  he is in every place  not some
of him in one place and some in another  but in each place the whole
maleldil  even in the smallness beyond thought  there is no way out of
the centre save into the bent will which casts itself into the nowhere 
blessed be he ”

“each thing was made for him  he is the centre  because we are with him 
each of us is at the centre  it is not as in a city of the darkened
world where they say that each must live for all  in his city all things
are made for each  when he died in the wounded world he died not for
men  but for each man  if each man had been the only man made  he would
have done no less  each thing  from the single grain of dust to the
strongest eldil  is the end and the final cause of all creation and the
mirror in which the beam of his brightness comes to rest and so returns
to him  blessed be he ”

“in the plan of the great dance plans without number interlock  and each
movement becomes in its season the breaking into flower of the whole
design to which all else had been directed  thus each is equally at the
centre and none are there by being equals  but some by giving place and
some by receiving it  the small things by their smallness and the great
by their greatness  and all the patterns linked and looped together by
the unions of a kneeling with a sceptred love  blessed be he ”

“he has immeasurable use for each thing that is made  that his love and
splendour may flow forth like a strong river which has need of a great
watercourse and fills alike the deep pools and the little crannies  that
are filled equally and remain unequal  and when it has filled them brim
full it flows over and makes new channels  we also have need beyond
measure of all that he has made  love me  my brothers  for i am
infinitely necessary to you and for your delight i was made  blessed be
he ”

“he has no need at all of anything that is made  an eldil is not more
needful to him than a grain of the dust  a peopled world no more needful
than a world that is empty  but all needless alike  and what all add to
him is nothing  we also have no need of anything that is made  love me 
my brothers  for i am infinitely superfluous  and your love shall be
like his  born neither of your need nor of my deserving  but a plain
bounty  blessed be he ”

“all things are by him and for him  he utters himself also for his own
delight and sees that he is good  he is his own begotten and what
proceeds from him is himself  blessed be he ”

“all that is made seems planless to the darkened mind  because there are
more plans than it looked for  in these seas there are islands where the
hairs of the turf are so fine and so closely woven together that unless
a man looked long at them he would see neither hairs nor weaving at all 
but only the same and the flat  so with the great dance  set your eyes
on one movement and it will lead you through all patterns and it will
seem to you the master movement  but the seeming will be true  let no
mouth open to gainsay it  there seems no plan because it is all plan 
there seems no centre because it is all centre  blessed be he ”

“yet this seeming also is the end and final cause for which he spreads
out time so long and heaven so deep  lest if we never met the dark  and
the road that leads no-whither  and the question to which no answer is
imaginable  we should have in our minds no likeness of the abyss of the
father  into which if a creature drop down his thoughts for ever he
shall hear no echo return to him  blessed  blessed  blessed be he ”

and now  by a transition which he did not notice  it seemed that what
had begun as speech was turned into sight  or into something that can be
remembered only as if it were seeing  he thought he saw the great dance 
it seemed to be woven out of the intertwining undulation of many cords
or bands of light  leaping over and under one another and mutually
embraced in arabesques and flower-like subtleties  each figure as he
looked at it became the master-figure or focus of the whole spectacle 
by means of which his eye disentangled all else and brought it into
unity—only to be itself entangled when he looked to what he had taken
for mere marginal decorations and found that there also the same
hegemony was claimed  and the claim made good  yet the former pattern
not thereby dispossessed but finding in its new subordination a
significance greater than that which it had abdicated  he could see also
 but the word “seeing” is now plainly inadequate  wherever the ribbons
or serpents of light intersected  minute corpuscles of momentary
brightness  and he knew somehow that these particles were the secular
generalities of which history tells—peoples  institutions  climates of
opinion  civilisations  arts  sciences  and the like—ephemeral
coruscations that piped their short song and vanished  the ribbons or
cords themselves  in which millions of corpuscles lived and died  were
things of some different kind  at first he could not say what  but he
knew in the end that most of them were individual entities  if so  the
time in which the great dance proceeds is very unlike time as we know
it  some of the thinner and more delicate cords were beings that we call
short-lived  flowers and insects  a fruit or a storm of rain  and once
 he thought  a wave of the sea  others were such things as we also think
lasting  crystals  rivers  mountains  or even stars  far above these in
girth and luminosity and flashing with colours from beyond our spectrum
were the lines of the personal beings  and yet as different from one
another in splendour as all of them from all the previous class  but not
all the cords were individuals  some were universal truths or universal
qualities  it did not surprise him then to find that these and the
persons were both cords and both stood together as against the mere
atoms of generality which lived and died in the clashing of their
streams  but afterwards  when he came back to earth  he wondered  and by
now the thing must have passed altogether out of the region of sight as
we understand it  for he says that the whole solid figure of these
enamoured and inter-inanimated circlings was suddenly revealed as the
mere superficies of a far vaster pattern in four dimensions  and that
figure as the boundary of yet others in other worlds  till suddenly as
the movement grew yet swifter  the interweaving yet more ecstatic  the
relevance of all to all yet more intense  as dimension was added to
dimension and that part of him which could reason and remember was
dropped farther and farther behind that part of him which saw  even
then  at the very zenith of complexity  complexity was eaten up and
faded  as a thin white cloud fades into the hard blue burning of the
sky  and a simplicity beyond all comprehension  ancient and young as
spring  illimitable  pellucid  drew him with cords of infinite desire
into its own stillness  he went up into such a quietness  a privacy  and
a freshness that at the very moment when he stood farthest from our
ordinary mode of being he had the sense of stripping off encumbrances
and awaking from trance  and coming to himself  with a gesture of
relaxation he looked about him       

the animals had gone  the two white figures had disappeared  tor and
tinidril and he were alone  in ordinary perelandrian daylight  early in
the morning 

“where are the beasts ” said ransom 

“they have gone about their small affairs ” said tinidril  “they have
gone to bring up their whelps and lay their eggs  to build their nests
and spin their webs and dig their burrows  to sing and play and to eat
and drink ”

“they did not wait long ” said ransom  “for i feel it is still early in
the morning ”

“but not the same morning ” said tor 

“we have been here long  then ” asked ransom 

“yes ” said tor  “i did not know it till now  but we have accomplished
one whole circle about arbol since we met on this mountain top ”

“a year ” said ransom  “a whole year  o heavens  what may by now have
happened in my own dark world  did you know  father  that so much time
was passing ”

“i did not feel it pass ” said tor  “i believe the waves of time will
often change for us henceforward  we are coming to have it in our own
choice whether we shall be above them and see many waves together or
whether we shall reach them one by one as we used to ”

“it comes into my mind ” said tinidril  “that to-day  now that the year
has brought us back to the same place in heaven  the eldils are coming
for piebald to take him back to his own world ”

“you are right  tinidril ” said tor  then he looked at ransom and said 
“there is a red dew coming up out of your foot  like a little spring ”

ransom looked down and saw that his heel was still bleeding  “yes ” he
said  “it is where the evil one bit me  the redness is of  hrū 
 blood  ”

“sit down  friend ” said tor  “and let me wash your foot in this pool ”
ransom hesitated but the king compelled him  so presently he sat on the
little bank and the king kneeled before him in the shallow water and
took the injured foot in his hand  he paused as he looked at it 

“so this is  hrū  ” he said at last  “i have never seen such a fluid
before  and this is the substance wherewith maleldil remade the worlds
before any world was made ”

he washed the foot for a long time but the bleeding did not stop  “does
it mean that piebald will die ” said tinidril at last 

“i do not think so ” said tor  “i think that any of his race who has
breathed the air that he has breathed and drunk the waters that he has
drunk since he came to the holy mountain will not find it easy to die 
tell me  friend  was it not so in your world that after they had lost
their paradise the men of your race did not learn to die quickly ”

“i had heard ” said ransom  “that those first generations were long
livers  but most take it for only a story or a poetry and i had not
thought of the cause ”

“oh ” said tinidril suddenly  “the eldila are come to take him ”

ransom looked round and saw  not the white manlike forms in which he had
last seen mars and venus  but only the almost invisible lights  the king
and queen apparently recognised the spirits in this guise also  as
easily  he thought  as an earthly king would recognise his acquaintance
even when they were not in court dress 

the king released ransoms foot and all three of them went towards the
white casket  its covering lay beside it on the ground  all felt an
impulse to delay 

“what is this that we feel  tor ” said tinidril 

“i dont know ” said the king  “one day i will give it a name  this is
not a day for making names ”

“it is like a fruit with a very thick shell ” said tinidril  “the joy of
our meeting when we meet again in the great dance is the sweet of it 
but the rind is thick—more years thick than i can count ”

“you see now ” said tor  “what that evil one would have done to us  if
we had listened to him we should now be trying to get at that sweet
without biting through the shell ”

“and so it would not be that sweet at all ” said tinidril 

“it is now his time to go ” said the tingling voice of an eldil  ransom
found no words to say as he laid himself down in the casket  the sides
rose up high above him like walls  beyond them  as if framed in a
coffin-shaped window  he saw the golden sky and the faces of tor and
tinidril  “you must cover my eyes ” he said presently  and the two human
forms went out of sight for a moment and returned  their arms were full
of the rose-red lilies  both bent down and kissed him  he saw the kings
hand lifted in blessing and then never saw anything again in that world 
they covered his face with the cool petals till he was blinded in a red
sweet-smelling cloud 

“is all ready ” said the kings voice  “farewell  friend and saviour 
farewell ” said both voices  “farewell till we three pass out of the
dimensions of time  speak of us always to maleldil as we speak always of
you  the splendour  the love  and the strength be upon you ”

then came the great cumbrous noise of the lid being fastened on above
him  then  for a few seconds  noises without  in the world from which he
was eternally divided  then his consciousness was engulfed 


                                the end

    in the text i naturally keep to what i thought and felt at the time 
    since this alone is first-hand evidence  but there is obviously room
    for much further speculation about the form in which  eldila  appear
    to our senses  the only serious considerations of the problem so far
    are to be sought in the early seventeenth century  as a starting
    point for future investigation i recommend the following from
    natvilcius   de aethereo et aerio corpors  basel   1627  ii  xii   
     liquet simplicem flammam sensibus nostris subjectam non esse corpus
    proprie dictum angeli vel daemonis  sed potius aut illius corporis
    sensorium aut superficiem corporis in coelesti dispositione locorum
    supra cogitationes humanas existentis   “it appears that the
    homogeneous flame perceived by our senses is not the body  properly
    so called  of an angel or daemon  but rather either the sensorium of
    that body or the surface of a body which exists after a manner
    beyond our conception in the celestial frame of spatial
    references”   by the “celestial frame of references” i take him to
    mean what we should now call “multi-dimensional space ” not  of
    course  that natvilcius knew anything about multi-dimensional
    geometry  but that he had reached empirically what mathematics has
    since reached on theoretical grounds 


                         
﻿                                preface


i have called this a fairy-tale in the hope that no one who dislikes
fantasy may be misled by the first two chapters into reading further 
and then complain of his disappointment  if you ask why—intending to
write about magicians  devils  pantomime animals  and planetary angels—i
nevertheless begin with such humdrum scenes and persons  i reply that i
am following the traditional fairy-tale  we do not always notice its
method  because the cottages  castles  woodcutters  and petty kings with
which a fairy-tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and
ogres to which it proceeds  but they were not remote at all to the men
who made and first enjoyed the stories  they were  indeed  more
realistic and commonplace than bracton college is to me  for many german
peasants had actually met cruel stepmothers  whereas i have never  in
any university  come across a college like bracton 

this is a “tall story” about devilry  though it has behind it a serious
“point” which i have tried to make in my  abolition of man   in the
story the outer rim of that devilry had to be shown touching the life of
some ordinary and respectable profession  i selected my own profession 
not  of course  because i think fellows of colleges more likely to be
thus corrupted than anyone else  but because my own profession is
naturally that which i know best  a very small university is imagined
because that has certain conveniences for fiction  edgestow has no
resemblance  save for its smallness  to durham—a university with which
the only connection i have ever had was entirely pleasant 

i believe that one of the central ideas of this tale came into my head
from conversations i had with a scientific colleague  some time before i
met a rather similar suggestion in the works of mr  olaf stapledon  if i
am mistaken in this  mr  stapledon is so rich in invention that he can
well afford to lend  and i admire his invention  though not his
philosophy  so much that i should feel no shame to borrow

“matrimony was ordained  thirdly ” said jane studdock to herself  “for
the mutual society  help  and comfort that the one ought to have of the
other ” she had not been to church since her schooldays until she went
there six months ago to be married  and the words of the service had
stuck in her mind 

through the open door she could see the tiny kitchen of the flat and
hear the loud  ungentle tick-tick of the clock  she had just left the
kitchen and knew how tidy it was  the breakfast things were washed up 
the tea towels were hanging above the stove  and the floor was mopped 
the beds were made and the rooms “done ” she had just returned from the
only shopping she need do that day  and it was still a minute before
eleven  except for getting her own lunch and tea there was nothing that
had to be done till six oclock  even supposing that mark was really
coming home for dinner  but there was a college meeting to-day  almost
certainly mark would ring up about tea-time to say that the meeting was
taking longer than he had expected and that he would have to dine in
college  the hours before her were as empty as the flat  the sun shone
and the clock ticked 

“mutual society  help  and comfort ” said jane bitterly  in reality
marriage had proved to be the door out of a world of work and
comradeship and laughter and innumerable things to do  into something
like solitary confinement  for some years before their marriage she had
never seen so little of mark as she had done in the last six months 
even when he was at home he hardly ever talked  he was always either
sleepy or intellectually preoccupied  while they had been friends  and
later when they were lovers  life itself had seemed too short for all
they had to say to each other  but now       why had he married her  was
he still in love  if so  “being in love” must mean totally different
things to men and women  was it the crude truth that all the endless
talks which had seemed to her  before they were married  the very medium
of love itself  had never been to him more than a preliminary 

“here i am  starting to waste another morning  mooning ” said jane to
herself sharply  “i  must  do some work ” by work she meant her
doctorate thesis on donne  she had always intended to continue her own
career as a scholar after she was married  that was one of the reasons
why they were to have no children  at any rate for a long time yet  jane
was not perhaps a very original thinker  and her plan had been to lay
great stress on donnes “triumphant vindication of the body ” she still
believed that if she got out all her note-books and editions and really
sat down to the job she could force herself back into her lost
enthusiasm for the subject  but before she did so—perhaps in order to
put off the moment of beginning—she turned over a newspaper which was
lying on the table and glanced at a picture on the back page 

the moment she saw the picture  she remembered her dream  she remembered
not only the dream but the measureless time after she had crept out of
bed and sat waiting for the first hint of morning  afraid to put on the
light for fear mark should wake up and fuss  yet feeling offended by the
sound of his regular breathing  he was an excellent sleeper  only one
thing ever seemed able to keep him awake after he had gone to bed  and
even that did not keep him awake for long 

the terror of this dream  like the terror of most dreams  evaporates in
the telling  but it must be set down for the sake of what came
afterwards 

she had begun by dreaming simply of a face  it was a foreign-looking
face  bearded and rather yellow  with a hooked nose  its expression was
frightening because it was frightened  the mouth sagged open and the
eyes stared as she had seen other mens eyes stare for a second or two
when some sudden shock had occurred  but this face seemed to be meeting
a shock that lasted for hours  then gradually she became aware of more 
the face belonged to a man who was sitting hunched up in one corner of a
little square room with white-washed walls—waiting  she thought  for
those who had him in their power  to come in and do something horrible
to him  at last the door was opened and a rather good-looking man with a
pointed grey beard came in  the prisoner seemed to recognise him as an
old acquaintance and they sat down together and began to talk  in all
the dreams which jane had hitherto dreamed  one either understood what
the dream-people were saying or else one did not hear it  but in this
dream—and that helped to make its extraordinary realism—the conversation
was in french and jane understood bits of it  but by no means all  just
as she would have done in real life  the visitor was telling the
prisoner something which he apparently intended him to regard as good
news  and the prisoner at first looked up with a gleam of hope in his
eye and said “ tiens       ah       ça marche ”  but then he wavered and
changed his mind  the visitor continued in a low  fluent voice to press
his point  he was a good-looking man in his rather cold way  but he wore
pince-nez  and these kept on catching the light so as to make his eyes
invisible  this  combined with the almost unnatural perfection of his
teeth  somehow gave jane a disagreeable impression  and this was
increased by the growing distress  and finally the terror  of the
prisoner  she could not make out what it was that the visitor was
proposing to him  but she did discover that the prisoner was under
sentence of death  whatever the visitor was offering him was something
that frightened him more than that  at this point the dream abandoned
all pretence to realism and became ordinary nightmare  the visitor 
adjusting his pince-nez and still smiling his cold smile  seized the
prisoners head between his two hands  he gave it a sharp turn—just as
jane had last summer seen men give a sharp turn to the helmet on a
divers head  the visitor unscrewed the prisoners head and took it
away  then all became confused  the head was still the centre of the
dream  but it was quite a different head now—a head with a reddish-white
beard all covered with earth  it belonged to an old man whom some people
were digging up in a kind of churchyard—a sort of ancient british 
druidical kind of man  in a long mantle  jane didnt mind this much at
first because she thought it was a corpse  then suddenly she noticed
that this ancient thing was coming to life  “look out ” she cried in her
dream  “hes alive  stop  stop  youre waking him ” but they did not
stop  the old  buried man sat up and began talking in something that
sounded vaguely like spanish  and this for some reason  frightened jane
so badly that she woke up 

that was the dream—no worse  if also no better  than many another
nightmare  but it was not the mere memory of a nightmare that made the
sitting-room of the flat swim before janes eyes and caused her to sit
down quickly for fear she should fall  the trouble was elsewhere  there 
on the back page of the newspaper  was the head she had seen in the
nightmare  the first head  if there had been two of them —the head of
the prisoner  with extreme reluctance she took up the paper  execution
of alcasan was the headline  and beneath it  scientist bluebeard goes to
guillotine  she remembered having vaguely followed the case  alcasan was
a distinguished radiologist in a neighbouring country—an arab by
descent  they said—who had cut short an otherwise brilliant career by
poisoning his wife  so that was the origin of her dream  she must have
looked at this photo in the paper—the man certainly had a very
unpleasant face—before going to bed  but no  that couldnt be it  it was
this mornings paper  but of course there must have been some earlier
picture which she had seen and forgotten—probably weeks ago when the
trial began  it was silly to have let it give her such a turn  and now
for donne  lets see  where were we  the ambiguous passage at the end of
 loves alchymie  

  hope not for minde in women  at their best
  sweetnesse and wit  they are but  mummy  possest 

“hope not for mind in women ” did any men really  want  mind in women 
but that wasnt the point  “i  must  get back my power of
concentrating ” said jane  and then  “was there a previous picture of
alcasan  supposing      ”

five minutes later she swept all her books away  went to the mirror  put
on her hat  and went out  she was not quite sure where she was going 
anywhere  to be out of that room  that flat  that whole house 


                                   ii

mark himself  meanwhile  was walking down to bracton college  and
thinking of a very different matter  he did not notice at all the
morning beauty of the little street that led him from the sandy hillside
suburb where he and jane lived down into the central and academic part
of edgestow 

though i am oxford bred and very fond of cambridge  i think that
edgestow is more beautiful than either  for one thing it is so small  no
maker of cars or sausages or marmalades has yet come to industrialise
the country town which is the setting of the university  and the
university itself is tiny  apart from bracton and from the
nineteenth-century womens college beyond the railway  there are only
two colleges  northumberland which stands below bracton on the river
wynd  and dukes opposite the abbey  bracton takes no undergraduates  it
was founded in 1300 for the support of ten learned men whose duties were
to pray for the soul of henry de bracton and to study the laws of
england  the number of fellows has gradually increased to forty  of whom
only six  apart from the bacon professor  now study law and of whom
none  perhaps  prays for the soul of bracton  mark studdock was himself
a sociologist and had been elected to a fellowship in that subject five
years ago  he was beginning to find his feet  if he had felt any doubt
on that point  which he did not  it would have been laid to rest when he
found himself meeting curry just outside the post office  and seen how
natural curry found it that they should walk to college together and
discuss the agenda for the meeting  curry was the sub-warden of bracton 

“yes ” said curry  “it will take the hell of a time  probably go on
after dinner  we shall have all the obstructionists wasting time as hard
as they can  but luckily thats the worst they can do ”

you would never have guessed from the tone of studdocks reply what
intense pleasure he derived from currys use of the pronoun “we ” so
very recently he had been an outsider  watching the proceedings of what
he then called “curry and his gang” with awe and with little
understanding  and making at college meetings short  nervous speeches
which never influenced the course of events  now he was inside  and
“curry and his gang” had become “we” or “the progressive element in
college ” it had all happened quite suddenly and was still sweet in the
mouth 

“you think itll go through  then ” said studdock 

“sure to ” said curry  “weve got the warden  and the bursar  and all
the chemical and bio-chemical people for a start  ive tackled pelham
and ted and theyre sound  ive made sancho believe that he sees the
point and that hes in favour of it  bill the blizzard will probably do
something pretty devastating  but hes bound to side with us if it comes
to a vote  besides  i havent yet told you  dicks going to be there  he
came up in time for dinner last night and got busy at once ”

studdocks mind darted hither and thither in search of some safe way to
conceal the fact that he did not know who dick was  in the nick of time
he remembered a very obscure colleague whose christian name was richard 

“telford ” said studdock in a puzzled voice  he knew very well that
telford could not be the dick that curry meant  and therefore threw a
slightly whimsical and ironical tone into his question 

“good lord  telford ” said curry with a laugh  “no  i mean lord
feverstone—dick devine as he used to be ”

“i  was  a little baffled by the idea of telford ” said studdock 
joining in the laugh  “im glad feverstone is coming  ive never met him
you know ”

“oh  but you must ” said curry  “look here  come and dine in my rooms
to-night  ive asked him ”

“i should like to very much ” said studdock quite truly  and then  after
a pause  “by the way  i suppose feverstones own position is quite
secure ”

“how do you mean ” asked curry 

“well  there was some talk  if you remember  as to whether someone who
was away quite so much could go on holding a fellowship ”

“oh  you mean glossop and all that ramp  nothing will come of that 
didnt you think it absolute blah ”

“as between ourselves  yes  but i confess if i were put up to explain
 in public  exactly why a man who is nearly always in london should go
on being a fellow of bracton  i shouldnt find it altogether easy  the
real reasons are the sort that watson would call imponderables ”

“i dont agree  i shouldnt have the least objection to explaining the
real reasons in public  isnt it important for a college like this to
have influential connections with the outer world  its not in the least
impossible that dick will be in the next cabinet  even already dick in
london has been a damn sight more use to the college than glossop and
half a dozen others of that sort have been by sitting here all their
lives ”

“yes  of course thats the real point  it would be a little difficult to
put in that form at a college meeting  though ”

“theres one thing ” said curry in a slightly less intimate tone  “that
perhaps you ought to know about dick ”

“whats that ”

“he got you your fellowship ”

mark was silent  he did not like things which reminded him that he had
once been not only outside the progressive element but even outside the
college  he did not always like curry either  his pleasure in being with
him was not that sort of pleasure 

“yes ” said curry  “denniston was your chief rival  between ourselves  a
good many people liked his papers better than yours  it was dick who
insisted all through that you were the sort of man we really wanted  he
went round to dukes and ferreted out all about you  he took the line
that the one thing to consider is the type of man we need  and be damned
to paper qualifications  and i must say he turned out to be right ”

“very kind of you ” said studdock with a little mock bow  he was
surprised at the turn the conversation had taken  it was an old rule at
bracton  as presumably in most colleges  that one never mentioned in the
presence of a man the circumstances of his own election  and studdock
had not realised till now that this also was one of the traditions the
progressive element was prepared to scrap  it had also never occurred to
him that his own election had depended on anything but the excellence of
his work in the fellowship examination  still less that it had been so
narrow a thing  he was so accustomed to his position by now that this
thought gave him the same curious sensation which a man has when he
discovers that his father once very nearly married a different woman 

“yes ” continued curry  pursuing another train of thought  “one sees now
that denniston would never have done  most emphatically not  a brilliant
man at that time  of course  but he seems to have gone quite off the
rails since then with all his distributivism and what not  they tell me
hes likely to end up in a monastery ”

“hes no fool  all the same ” said studdock 

“im glad youre going to meet dick ” said curry  “we havent time now 
but theres one thing about him i wanted to discuss with you ”

studdock looked enquiringly at him 

“james and i and one or two others ” said curry in a somewhat lower
voice  “have been thinking he ought to be the new warden  but here we
are ”

“its not yet twelve ” said studdock  “what about popping into the
bristol for a drink ”

into the bristol they accordingly went  it would not have been easy to
preserve the atmosphere in which the progressive element operated
without a good many of these little courtesies  this weighed harder on
studdock than on curry who was unmarried and had a sub-wardens stipend 
but the bristol was a very pleasant place  studdock bought a double
whisky for his companion and half a pint of beer for himself 


                                  iii

the only time i was a guest at bracton i persuaded my host to let me
into the wood and leave me there alone for an hour  he apologised for
locking me in 

very few people were allowed into bragdon wood  the gate was by inigo
jones and was the only entry  a high wall enclosed the wood  which was
perhaps a quarter of a mile broad and a mile from east to west  if you
came in from the street and went through the college to reach it  the
sense of gradual penetration into a holy of holies was very strong 
first you went through the newton quadrangle which is dry and gravelly 
florid  but beautiful  georgian buildings look down upon it  next you
must enter a cool tunnel-like passage  nearly dark at midday unless
either the door into hall should be open on your right or the buttery
hatch on your left  giving you a glimpse of indoor daylight falling on
panels  and a whiff of the smell of fresh bread  when you emerged from
this tunnel you would find yourself in the medieval college  in the
cloister of the much smaller quadrangle called republic  the grass here
looks very green after the aridity of newton and the very stone of the
buttresses that rise from it gives the impression of being soft and
alive  chapel is not far off  the hoarse  heavy noise of the works of a
great and old clock comes to you from somewhere overhead  you went along
this cloister  past slabs and urns and busts that commemorate dead
bractonians  and then down shallow steps into the full daylight of the
quadrangle called lady alice  the buildings to your left and right were
seventeenth-century work  humble  almost domestic in character  with
dormer windows  mossy and grey-tiled  you were in a sweet  protestant
world  you found yourself  perhaps  thinking of bunyan or of waltons
 lives   there were no buildings straight ahead on the fourth side of
lady alice  only a row of elms and a wall  and here first one became
aware of the sound of running water and the cooing of wood pigeons  the
street was so far off by now that there were no other noises  in the
wall there was a door  it led you into a covered gallery pierced with
narrow windows on either side  looking out through these you discovered
that you were crossing a bridge and the dark brown dimpled wynd was
flowing under you  now you were very near your goal  a wicket at the far
end of the bridge brought you out on the fellows bowling-green  and
across that you saw the high wall of the wood and through the inigo
jones gate you caught a glimpse of sunlit green and deep shadows 

i suppose the mere fact of being walled in gave the wood part of its
peculiar quality  for when a thing is enclosed the mind does not
willingly regard it as common  as i went forward over the quiet turf i
had the sense of being received  the trees were just so wide apart that
one saw uninterrupted foliage in the distance  but the place where one
stood seemed always to be a clearing  surrounded by a world of shadows 
one walked in mild sunshine  except for the sheep whose nibbling kept
the grass so short and who sometimes raised their long  foolish faces to
stare at me  i was quite alone  and it felt more like the loneliness of
a very large room in a deserted house than like any ordinary solitude
out of doors  i remember thinking  “this is the sort of place which  as
a child  one would have been rather afraid of or else would have liked
very much indeed ” a moment later i thought  “but when alone—really
alone—everyone is a child  or no one ” youth and age touch only the
surface of our lives 

half a mile is a short walk  yet it seemed a long time before i came to
the centre of the wood  i knew it was the centre  for there was the
thing i had chiefly come to see  it was a well  a well with steps going
down to it and the remains of an ancient pavement about it  it was very
imperfect now  i did not step on it  but i lay down in the grass and
touched it with my fingers  for this was the heart of bracton or bragdon
wood  out of this all the legends had come and on this  i suspected  the
very existence of the college had originally depended  the
archaeologists were agreed that the masonry was very late british-roman
work  done on the very eve of the anglo-saxon invasion  how bragdon the
wood was connected with bracton the lawyer was a mystery  but i fancy
myself that the bracton family had availed themselves of an accidental
similarity in the names to believe  or make believe  that they had
something to do with it  certainly  if all that was told were true  or
even half of it  the wood was older than the bractons  i suppose no one
now would attach much importance to strabos  balachthon   though it had
led a sixteenth-century warden of the college to say that “we know not
by ancientest report of any britain without bragdon ” but the medieval
song takes us back to the fourteenth century 

   in bragdon bricht this ende dai 
   herde ich merlin ther he lai 
   singende woo and welawai  

it is good enough evidence that the well with the british-roman pavement
was already “merlins well ” though the name is not found till queen
elizabeths reign  when good warden shovel surrounded the wood with a
wall “for the taking away of all profane and heathenish superstitions
and the deterring of the vulgar sort from all wakes  may games 
dancings  mummings  and baking of morgans bread  heretofore used about
the fountain called in vanity merlins well  and utterly to be renounced
and abominated as a gallimaufrey of papistry  gentilism  lewdness and
dunsicall folly ” not that the college had by this action renounced its
own interest in the place  old dr  shovel  who lived to be nearly a
hundred  can scarcely have been cold in his grave when one of cromwells
major-generals  conceiving it his business to destroy “the groves and
the high places ” sent a few troopers with power to impress the country
people for this pious work  the scheme came to nothing in the end  but
there had been a bicker between the college and the troopers in the
heart of bragdon  and the fabulously learned and saintly richard crowe
had been killed by a musket ball on the very steps of the well  he would
be a brave man who would accuse crowe either of popery or “gentilism” 
yet the story is that his last words had been “marry  sirs  if merlin
who was the devils son was a true kings man as ever ate bread  is it
not a shame that you  being but the sons of bitches  must be rebels and
regicides ” and always  through all changes  every warden of bracton  on
the day of his election  had drunk a ceremonial draught of water from
merlins well in the great cup which both for its antiquity and for its
beauty  was the greatest of the bracton treasures 

all this i thought of  lying beside merlins well  beside the well which
must certainly date from merlins time if there had ever been a real
merlin  lying where sir kenelm digby had lain all one summer night and
seen a certain strange appearance  where collins the poet had lain  and
where george the third had cried  where the brilliant and much-loved
nathaniel fox had composed the famous poem three weeks before he was
killed in france  the air was so still and the billows of foliage so
heavy above me  that i fell asleep  i was wakened by my friend hallowing
to me from a long way off 


                                   iv

the most controversial business before the college meeting was the
question of selling bragdon wood  the purchaser was the n i c e   the
national institute of co-ordinated experiments  they wanted a site for
the building which would worthily house this remarkable organisation 
the n i c e  was the first-fruit of that constructive fusion between the
state and the laboratory on which so many thoughtful people base their
hopes of a better world  it was to be free from almost all the tiresome
restraints—“red tape” was the word its supporters used—which have
hitherto hampered research in this country  it was also largely free
from the restraints of economy  for  as it was argued  a nation which
can spend so many millions a day on a war can surely afford a few
millions a month on productive research in peace-time  the building
proposed for it was one which would make a quite noticeable addition to
the skyline of new york  the staff was to be enormous  and their
salaries princely  persistent pressure and endless diplomacy on the part
of the senate of edgestow had lured the new institute away from oxford 
from cambridge  from london  it had thought of all these in turn as
possible scenes for its labours  at times the progressive element in
edgestow had almost despaired  but success was now practically certain 
if the n i c e  could get the necessary land  it would come to edgestow 
and once it came  then  as everyone felt  things would at last begin to
move  curry had even expressed a doubt whether  eventually  oxford and
cambridge could survive as major universities at all 

three years ago  if mark studdock had come to a college meeting at which
such a question was to be decided  he would have expected to hear the
claims of sentiment against progress and beauty against utility openly
debated  to-day  as he took his seat in the soler  the long upper room
on the south of lady alice  he expected no such matter  he knew now that
that was not the way things are done 

the progressive element managed its business really very well  most of
the fellows did not know when they came into the soler that there was
any question of selling the wood  they saw  of course  from their agenda
paper that item 15 was “sale of college land ” but as that appeared at
almost every college meeting  they were not very interested  on the
other hand they did see that item 1 was “questions about bragdon wood ”
these were not concerned with the proposed sale  curry  who rose as
sub-warden to introduce them  had a few letters to read to the college 
the first was from a society concerned for the preservation of ancient
monuments  i think myself that this society had been ill-advised to make
two complaints in one letter  it would have been wiser if they had
confined themselves to drawing the colleges attention to the disrepair
of the wall round the wood  when they went on to urge the desirability
of building some protection over the well itself and even to point out
that they had urged this before  the college began to be restive  and
when  as a kind of afterthought  they expressed a wish that the college
could be a little more accommodating to serious antiquaries who wanted
to examine the well  the college became definitely ill-tempered  i would
not like to accuse a man in currys position of misreading a letter  but
his reading of this letter was certainly not such as to gloss over any
defects in the tone of the original composition  before he sat down 
nearly everyone in the room desired strongly to make the outer world
understand that bragdon wood was the private property of bracton college
and that the outer world had better mind its own business  then he rose
again to read another letter  this was from a society of spiritualists
who wanted leave to investigate the “reported phenomena” in the wood—a
letter “connected” as curry said  “with the next which  with the
wardens permission  i will now read to you ” this was from a firm who
had heard of the spiritualists proposal and wanted permission to make a
film  not exactly of the phenomena  but of the spiritualists looking for
the phenomena  curry was directed to write short refusals to all three
letters 

then came a new voice from quite a different part of the soler  lord
feverstone had risen  he fully agreed with the action which the college
had taken about these impertinent letters from various busybodies
outside  but was it not  after all  a fact  that the wall of the wood
 was  in a very unsatisfactory condition  a good many fellows—studdock
was not one of them—imagined they were watching a revolt on feverstones
part against “curry and his gang” and became intensely interested 
almost at once the bursar  james busby  was on his feet  he welcomed
lord feverstones question  in his bursarial capacity he had recently
taken expert advice about the wall of the wood  “unsatisfactory” was  he
feared  much too mild a word to describe its condition  nothing but a
complete new wall would really meet the situation  with great difficulty
the probable cost of this was elicited from him  and when the college
heard the figure it gasped  lord feverstone enquired icily whether the
bursar was seriously proposing that the college should undertake such an
expense  busby  a very large ex-clergyman with a bushy black beard 
replied with some temper that he had proposed nothing  if he  were  to
make a suggestion it would be that the question could not be treated in
isolation from some important financial considerations which it would
become his duty to lay before them later in the day  there was a pause
at this ominous statement  until gradually  one by one  the “outsiders”
and “obstructionists ” the men not included in the progressive element 
began coming into the debate  most of these found it hard to believe
that nothing short of a complete new wall would be any use  the
progressive element let them talk for nearly ten minutes  then it looked
once again as if lord feverstone were actually leading the outsiders  he
wanted to know whether it was possible that the bursar and the
preservation committee could really find no alternative between building
a new wall and allowing bragdon wood to degenerate into a common  he
pressed for an answer  some of the outsiders even began to feel that he
was being too rude to the bursar  at last the bursar answered in a low
voice that he  had  in a purely theoretical way got some facts about
possible alternatives  a barbed wire fence—but the rest was drowned in a
roar of disapproval  during which old canon jewel was heard to say that
he would sooner have every tree in the wood felled to the ground than
see it caged in barbed wire  finally the matter was postponed for
consideration at the next meeting 

the next item was one of those which the majority of the fellows could
not understand  it involved the recapitulation  by curry  of a long
correspondence between the college and the senate of the university
about the proposed incorporation of the n i c e  in the university of
edgestow  the words “committed to” kept recurring in the debate that
followed  “we appear ” said watson  “to have pledged ourselves as a
college to the fullest possible support of the new institute ” “we
appear ” said feverstone  “to have tied ourselves up hand and foot and
given the university  carte blanche  ” what all this actually amounted
to never became clear to any of the outsiders  they remembered fighting
hard at a previous meeting against the n i c e  and all its works  and
being defeated  but every effort to find out what their defeat had
meant  though answered with great lucidity by curry  served only to
entangle them further in the impenetrable mazes of the university
constitution and the still darker mystery of the relations between
university and college  the result of the discussion was to leave them
under the impression that the honour of the college was now involved in
the establishment of the n i c e  at edgestow 

during this item the thoughts of more than one fellow had turned to
lunch and attention had wandered  but when curry rose at five minutes to
one to introduce item 3  there was a sharp revival of interest  it was
called “rectification of an anomaly of the stipends in junior fellows ”
i would not like to say what the most junior fellows of bracton were
getting at this time  but i believe it hardly covered the expenses of
their residence in college  which was compulsory  studdock who had only
recently emerged from this class felt great sympathy with them  he
understood the look in their faces  the rectification  if it went
through  would mean to them clothes and holidays and meat for lunch and
a chance to buy a half  instead of a fifth  of the books they needed 
all their eyes were fixed on the bursar when he rose to reply to currys
proposal  he hoped that no one would imagine he approved the anomaly
which had  in 1910  excluded the lowest class of the fellows from the
new clauses in the eighteenth paragraph of statute 17  he felt sure that
everyone present would  wish  it to be rectified  but it was his duty 
as bursar  to point out that this was the second proposal involving very
heavy expenditure which had come before them that morning  he could only
say of this  as he had said of the previous proposal  that it could not
be isolated from the whole problem of the present financial position of
the college which he hoped to lay before them during the course of the
afternoon  a great deal more was said  but the bursar remained
unanswered  the matter was postponed  and when  at quarter to two  the
fellows came surging out of the soler for lunch  hungry and headachy and
ravenous for tobacco  every junior had it fixed in his mind that a new
wall for the wood and a rise in his own stipend were strictly exclusive
alternatives  “that darn wood has been in our way all morning ” said
one  “were not out of it yet ” answered another 

in this frame of mind the college returned to the soler after lunch to
consider its finances  busby  the bursar  was naturally the principal
speaker  it is very hot in the soler on a sunny afternoon  and the
smooth flow of the bursars exposition  and even the flashing of his
level  white teeth above his beard  he had remarkably fine teeth  had a
sort of hypnotic power  fellows of colleges do not always find money
matters easy to understand  if they did they would probably not have
been the sort of men who become fellows of colleges  they gathered that
the situation was bad  very bad indeed  some of the youngest and most
inexperienced members ceased to wonder whether they would get a new wall
or a rise of stipend and began to wonder instead whether the college
could continue to function at all  the times  as the bursar so truly
said  were extraordinarily difficult  older members had heard of such
times very often before from dozens of previous bursars and were less
disturbed  i am not suggesting for a moment that the bursar of bracton
was in any way misrepresenting the position  it is very seldom that the
affairs of a large corporation  indefinitely committed to the
advancement of learning  can be described as being  in a quite
unambiguous sense  satisfactory  his delivery was excellent  each
sentence was a model of lucidity  and if his hearers found the gist of
his whole statement less clear than the parts  that may have been their
own fault  some minor retrenchments and re-investments which he
suggested were unanimously approved and the college adjourned for tea in
a chastened mood  studdock rang up jane and told her he would not be
home for dinner 

it was not till six oclock that all the converging lines of thought and
feeling aroused by the earlier business came together upon the question
of selling bragdon wood  it was not called “the sale of bragdon wood ”
the bursar called it the “sale of the area coloured pink on the plan
which  with the wardens permission  i will now pass round the table ”
he pointed out quite frankly that this involved the loss of  part  of
the wood  in fact  the proposed n i c e  site still left to the college
a strip about sixteen feet broad along the far half of the south side 
but there was no deception for the fellows had the plan to look at with
their own eyes  it was a small-scale plan and not perhaps perfectly
accurate—only meant to give one a general idea  in answer to questions
he admitted that unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—the well itself
was in the area which the n i c e  wanted  the rights of the college to
access would  of course  be guaranteed  and the well and its pavement
would be preserved by the institute in a manner to satisfy all the
archaeologists in the world  he refrained from offering any advice and
merely mentioned the quite astonishing figure which the n i c e  was
offering  after that  the meeting became lively  the advantages of the
sale discovered themselves one by one like ripe fruit dropping into the
hand  it solved the problem of the wall  it solved the problem of
protecting ancient monuments  it solved the financial problem  it looked
like solving the problem of the junior fellows stipends  it appeared
further that the n i c e  regarded this as the only possible site in
edgestow  if by any chance bracton would not sell  the whole scheme
miscarried and the institute would undoubtedly go to cambridge  it was
even drawn out of the bursar by much questioning that he knew of a
cambridge college very anxious to sell 

the few real “die-hards” present  to whom bragdon wood was almost a
basic assumption of life  could hardly bring themselves to realise what
was happening  when they found their voices  they struck a discordant
note amid the general buzz of cheerful comment  they were manœuvred into
the position of appearing as the party who passionately desired to see
bragdon surrounded with barbed wire  when at last old jewel  blind and
shaky and almost weeping  rose to his feet  his voice was hardly
audible  men turned round to gaze at  and some to admire  the clear-cut 
half-childish face and the white hair which had become more conspicuous
as the long room grew darker  but only those close to him could hear
what he said  at this moment lord feverstone sprang to his feet  folded
his arms  and looking straight at the old man said in a very loud  clear
voice 

“if canon jewel wishes us  not  to hear his views  i suggest that his
end could be better attained by silence ”

jewel had been already an old man in the days before the first war when
old men were treated with kindness  and he had never succeeded in
getting used to the modern world  he stared with puzzled eyes in the
direction of feverstone  for a moment as he stood with his head thrust
forward  people thought he was going to reply  then quite suddenly he
spread out his hands with a gesture of helplessness  shrunk back  and
began laboriously to resume his chair 

the motion was carried 


                                   v

after leaving the flat that morning jane also had gone down to edgestow
and bought a hat  she had before now expressed some contempt for the
kind of woman who buys hats  as a man buys drinks  for a stimulant and a
consolation  it did not occur to her that she was doing so herself on
this occasion  she liked her clothes to be rather severe and in colours
that were really good on serious aesthetic grounds—clothes which would
make it plain to everyone that she was an intelligent adult and not a
woman of the chocolate-box variety—and because of this preference she
did not know that she was interested in clothes at all  she was
therefore a little annoyed when mrs  dimble met her coming out of
sparrows and said  “hullo  dear  been buying a hat  come home to lunch
and lets see it  cecil has the car just round the corner ”

cecil dimble  a fellow of northumberland  had been janes tutor for her
last years as a student  and mrs  dimble  one tended to call her “mother
dimble”  had been a kind of universal aunt to all the girls of her year 
a liking for the female pupils of ones husband is not  perhaps  so
common as might be wished among dons wives  but mrs  dimble appeared to
like all dr  dimbles pupils of both sexes and the dimbles house  away
on the far side of the river  was a kind of noisy  salon  all the term 
she had been particularly fond of jane with that kind of affection which
a humorous  easy natured and childless woman sometimes feels for a girl
whom she thinks pretty and slightly absurd  for the last year or so jane
had been somewhat losing sight of the dimbles and felt rather guilty
about it  she accepted the invitation to lunch 

they drove over the bridge to the north of bracton and then south along
the bank of the wynd  past the cottages  then left and eastward at the
norman church and down the straight road with the poplars on one side
and the wall of bragdon wood on the other  and so finally to the
dimbles front door 

“how lovely its looking ” said jane quite sincerely as she got out of
the car  the dimbles garden was famous 

“youd better take a good look at it then ” said dr  dimble 

“what do you mean ” asked jane 

“havent you told her ” said dr  dimble to his wife 

“i havent screwed myself up to it yet ” said mrs  dimble  “besides 
poor dear  her husband is one of the villains of the piece  anyway  i
expect she knows ”

“ive no idea what youre talking about ” said jane 

“your own college is being so tiresome  dear  theyre turning us out 
they wont renew the lease ”

“oh  mrs  dimble ” exclaimed jane  “and i didnt even know this was
bracton property ”

“there you are ” said mrs  dimble  “one half of the world doesnt know
how the other half lives  here have i been imagining that you were using
all your influence with mr  studdock to try to save us  whereas in
reality——”

“mark never talks to me about college business ”

“good husbands never do ” said dr  dimble  “at least only about the
business of other peoples colleges  thats why margaret knows all about
bracton and nothing about northumberland  is no one coming in to have
lunch ”

dimble guessed that bracton was going to sell the wood and everything
else it owned on that side of the river  the whole region seemed to him
now even more of a paradise than when he first came to live there
twenty-five years ago  and he felt much too strongly on the subject to
wish to talk about it before the wife of one of the bracton men 

“youll have to wait for your lunch till ive seen janes new hat ” said
mother dimble  and forthwith hurried jane upstairs  then followed some
minutes of conversation which was strictly feminine in the old-fashioned
sense  jane  while preserving a certain sense of superiority  found it
indefinably comforting  and though mrs  dimble had really the wrong
point of view about such things  there was no denying that the one small
alteration which she suggested did go to the root of the matter  when
the hat was being put away again mrs  dimble suddenly said 

“theres nothing wrong  is there ”

“wrong ” said jane  “why  what should there be ”

“youre not looking yourself ”

“oh  im all right ” said jane  aloud  mentally she added  “shes dying
to know whether im going to have a baby  that sort of woman always is ”

“do you hate being kissed ” said mrs  dimble unexpectedly 

“do i hate being kissed ” thought jane to herself  “that indeed is the
question  do i hate being kissed  hope not for mind in women——” she had
intended to reply “of course not ” but inexplicably  and to her great
annoyance  found herself crying instead  and then  for a moment  mrs 
dimble became simply a grown-up as grown-ups had been when one was a
very small child  large  warm  soft objects to whom one ran with bruised
knees or broken toys  when she thought of her childhood jane usually
remembered those occasions on which the voluminous embrace of nurse or
mother had been unwelcome and resisted as an insult to ones maturity 
now  for the moment  she was back in those forgotten  yet not
infrequent  times when fear or misery induced a willing surrender and
surrender brought comfort  not to detest being petted and pawed was
contrary to her whole theory of life  yet before they went downstairs
she had told mrs  dimble that she was not going to have a baby but was a
bit depressed from being very much alone and from a nightmare 

during lunch dr  dimble talked about the arthurian legend  “its really
wonderful ” he said  “how the whole thing hangs together  even in a late
version like malorys  youve noticed how there are two sets of
characters  theres guinevere and launcelot and all those people in the
centre  all very courtly and nothing particularly british about them 
but then in the background—on the other side of arthur  so to
speak—there are all those  dark  people like morgan and morgawse  who
are very british indeed and usually more or less hostile though they are
his own relatives  mixed up with magic  you remember that wonderful
phrase  how queen morgan set all the country in fire with ladies that
were enchantresses  merlin too  of course  is british  though not
hostile  doesnt it look very like a picture of britain as it must have
been on the eve of the invasion ”

“how do you mean  dr  dimble ” said jane 

“well  wouldnt there have been one section of society that was almost
purely roman  people wearing togas and talking a celticised
latin—something that would sound to us rather like spanish  and fully
christian  but farther up country  in the out-of-the-way places  cut off
by the forests  there would have been little courts ruled by real old
british under-kings  talking something like welsh  and practising a
certain amount of the druidical religion ”

“and which would arthur himself have been ” said jane  it was silly that
her heart should have missed a beat at the words “rather like spanish ”

“thats just the point ” said dr  dimble  “one can imagine a man of the
old british line  but also a christian and a fully-trained general with
roman technique  trying to pull this whole society together and almost
succeeding  thered be jealousy from his own british family  and the
romanised section—the lancelots and lionels—would look down on the
britons  thatd be why kay is always represented as a boor  he is part
of the native strain  and always that under-tow  that tug back to
druidism ”

“and where would merlin be ”

“yes        hes the really interesting figure  did the whole thing fail
because he died so soon  has it ever struck you what an odd creation
merlin is  hes not evil  yet hes a magician  he is obviously a druid 
yet he knows all about the grail  hes the devils son  but then
layamon goes out of his way to tell you that the kind of being who
fathered merlin neednt have been bad after all  you remember  there
dwell in the sky many kinds of wights  some of them are good  and some
work evil ”

“it  is  rather puzzling  i hadnt thought of it before ”

“i often wonder ” said dr  dimble  “whether merlin doesnt represent the
last trace of something the later tradition has quite forgotten
about—something that became impossible when the only people in touch
with the supernatural were either white or black  either priests or
sorcerers ”

“what a horrid idea ” said mrs  dimble  who had noticed that jane seemed
to be preoccupied  “anyway  merlin happened a long time ago if he
happened at all  and hes safely dead and buried under bragdon wood as
we all know ”

“buried but  not  dead  according to the story ” corrected dr  dimble 

“ugh ” said jane involuntarily  but dr  dimble was musing aloud 

“i wonder what they  will  find if they start digging up that place for
the foundations of their n i c e  ” he said 

“first mud and then water ” said mrs  dimble  “thats why they cant
really build it there ”

“so youd think ” said her husband  “and if so  why should they want to
come here at all  a little cockney like jules is not likely to be
influenced by any poetic fancy about merlins mantle having fallen on
him ”

“merlins mantle indeed ” said mrs  dimble 

“yes ” said the doctor  “its a rum idea  i dare say some of his set
would like to recover the mantle well enough  whether theyll be big
enough to fill it is another matter  i dont think theyd like it if the
old man himself came back to life along with it ”

“that childs going to faint ” said mrs  dimble suddenly jumping up 

“hullo  whats the matter ” said dr  dimble  looking with amazement at
janes face  “is the room too hot for you ”

“oh  its too ridiculous ” said jane 

“lets come into the drawing-room ” said dr  dimble  “here  lean on my
arm ”

a little later  in the drawing-room  seated beside a window that opened
onto the lawn  now strewn with bright yellow leaves  jane attempted to
excuse her absurd behaviour by telling the story of her dream  “i
suppose ive given myself away dreadfully ” she said  “you can both
start psycho-analysing me now ”

from dr  dimbles face jane might have indeed conjectured that her dream
had shocked him exceedingly  “extraordinary thing       most
extraordinary ” he kept muttering  “ two  heads  and one of them
alcasans  now is that a false scent ”

“dont  cecil ” said mrs  dimble 

“do you think i ought to be analysed ” said jane 

“analysed ” said dr  dimble  glancing at her as if he had not quite
understood  “oh  i see  you mean going to brizeacre or someone of that
sort ” jane realised that her question had recalled him from some quite
different train of thought and even—disconcertingly—that the problem of
her own health had been shouldered aside  the telling of her dream had
raised some other problem  though what this was she could not even
imagine 

dr  dimble looked out of the window  “there is my dullest pupil just
ringing the bell ” he said  “i must go to the study and listen to an
essay on swift beginning swift was born  must try to keep my mind on
it  too  which wont be easy ” he rose and stood for a moment with his
hand on janes shoulder  “look here ” he said  “im not going to give
any advice  but if you do decide to go to anyone about that dream  i
wish you would  first  consider going to someone whose address margery
or i will give you ”

“you dont believe in mr  brizeacre ” said jane 

“i cant explain ” said dr  dimble  “not now  its all so complicated 
try not to bother about it  but if you  do   just let us know first 
good-bye ”

almost immediately after his departure some other visitors arrived  so
that there was no opportunity of further private conversation between
jane and her hostess  she left the dimbles about half an hour later and
walked home  not along the road with the poplars but by the footpath
across the common  past the donkeys and the geese  with the towers and
spires of edgestow to her left and the old windmill on the horizon to
her right 




                                  two
                       dinner with the sub-warden 


                                   i

“this is a blow ” said curry  standing in front of the fireplace in his
magnificent rooms which overlooked newton  they were the best set in
college 

“something from n o  ” said james busby  he and lord feverstone and mark
were all drinking sherry before dining with curry  n o   which stood for
 non olet   was the nickname of charles place  the warden of bracton 
his election to this post  some fifteen years before  had been one of
the earliest triumphs of the progressive element  by dint of saying that
the college needed “new blood” and must be shaken out of its “academic
grooves” they had succeeded in bringing in an elderly civil servant who
had certainly never been contaminated by academic weaknesses since he
left his rather obscure cambridge college in the previous century  but
who had written a monumental report on national sanitation  the subject
had  if anything  rather recommended him to the progressive element 
they regarded it as a slap in the face for the  dilettanti  and
die-hards  who replied by christening their new warden  non olet   but
gradually even places supporters had adopted the name  for place had
not answered their expectations  having turned out to be a dyspeptic
with a taste for philately  whose voice was so seldom heard that some of
the junior fellows did not know what it sounded like 

“yes  blast him ” said curry  “wishes to see me on a most important
matter as soon as i can conveniently call on him after dinner ”

“that means ” said the bursar  “that jewel and co  have been getting at
him and want to find some way of going back on the whole business ”

“i dont give a damn for that ” said curry  “how can you go back on a
resolution  it isnt that  but its enough to muck up the whole
evening ”

“only your evening ” said feverstone  “dont forget to leave out that
very special brandy of yours before you go ”

“jewel  good god ” said busby  burying his left hand in his beard 

“i was rather sorry for old jewel ” said mark  his motives for saying
this were very mixed  to do him justice  it must be said that the quite
unexpected and apparently unnecessary brutality of feverstones
behaviour to the old man had disgusted him  and then  too  the whole
idea of his debt to feverstone in the matter of his own fellowship had
been rankling all day  who was this man feverstone  but paradoxically 
even while he felt that the time had come for asserting his own
independence and showing that his agreement with all the methods of the
progressive element must not be taken for granted  he also felt that a
little independence would raise him to a higher position within that
element itself  if the idea “feverstone will think all the more of you
for showing your teeth” had occurred to him in so many words  he would
have probably have rejected it as servile  but it didnt 

“sorry for jewel ” said curry  wheeling round  “you wouldnt say that if
you knew what he was like in his prime ”

“i agree with you ” said feverstone to mark  “but then i take the
clausewitz view  total war is the most humane in the long run  i shut
him up instantaneously  now that hes got over the shock hes quite
enjoying himself  because ive fully confirmed everything hes been
saying about the younger generation for the last forty years  what was
the alternative  to let him drivel on until hed worked himself into a
coughing fit or a heart attack  and give him in addition the
disappointment of finding that he was treated civilly ”

“thats a point of view  certainly ” said mark 

“damn it all ” continued feverstone  “no man likes to have his
stock-in-trade taken away  what would poor curry  here  do if the
die-hards one day all refused to do any die-harding  othellos
occupation would be gone ”

“dinner is served  sir ” said currys “shooter”—for that is what they
call a college servant at bracton 

“thats all rot  dick ” said curry as they sat down  “theres nothing i
should like better than to see the end of all these die-hards and
obstructionists and be able to get on with the job  you dont suppose i
 like  having to spend all my time merely getting the road clear ” mark
noticed that his host was a little nettled at lord feverstones banter 
the latter had an extremely virile and infectious laugh  mark felt he
was beginning to like him 

“the job being        ” said feverstone  not exactly glancing  much less
winking  at mark  but making him feel that he was somehow being included
in the fun 

“well  some of us have got work of our own to do ” replied curry 
dropping his voice to give it a more serious tone  almost as some people
drop their voices to speak of medical or religious matters 

“i never knew you were  that  sort of person ” said feverstone 

“thats the worst of the whole system ” said curry  “in a place like
this youve either got to be content to see everything go to pieces—i
mean  become stagnant—or else to sacrifice your own career as a scholar
to all these infernal college politics  one of these days i  shall 
chuck that side of it and get down to my book  the stuffs all there 
you know  feverstone  one long vacation clear and i really believe i
could put it into shape ”

mark  who had never seen curry baited before  was beginning to enjoy
himself 

“i see ” said feverstone  “in order to keep the place going as a learned
society  all the best brains in it have to give up doing anything about
learning ”

“exactly ” said curry  “thats just—” and then stopped  uncertain
whether he was being taken quite seriously  feverstone burst into
laughter  the bursar  who had up till now been busily engaged in eating 
wiped his beard carefully and spoke 

“all thats very well in theory ” he said  “but i think currys quite
right  supposing he resigned his office as sub-warden and retired into
his cave  he might give us a thundering good book on economics——”

“economics ” said feverstone  lifting his eyebrows 

“i happen to be a military historian  james ” said curry  he was often
somewhat annoyed at the difficulty which his colleagues seemed to find
in remembering what particular branch of learning he had been elected to
pursue 

“i mean military history  of course ” said busby  “as i say  he might
give us a thundering good book on military history  but it would be
superseded in twenty years  whereas the work he is actually doing for
the college will benefit it for centuries  this whole business  now  of
bringing the n i c e  to edgestow  what about a thing like that 
feverstone  im not speaking merely of the financial side of it  though
as bursar i naturally rate that pretty high  but think of the new life 
the awakening of new vision  the stirring of dormant impulses  what
would any book on economics——”

“military history ” said feverstone gently  but this time busby did not
hear him 

“what would any book on economics be  compared with a thing like that ”
he continued  “i look upon it as the greatest triumph of practical
idealism that this century has yet seen ”

the good wine was beginning to do its good office  we have all known the
kind of clergyman who tends to forget his clerical collar after the
third glass  but busbys habit was the reverse  it was after the third
glass that he began to remember his collar  as wine and candlelight
loosened his tongue  the parson still latent within him after thirty
years apostasy began to wake into a strange galvanic life 

“as you chaps know ” he said  “i make no claim to orthodoxy  but if
religion is understood in the deepest sense  i have no hesitation in
saying that curry  by bringing the n i c e  to edgestow  has done more
for it in one year than jewel has done in his whole life ”

“well ” said curry modestly  “thats rather the sort of thing one had
hoped  i mightnt put it exactly as you do  james——”

“no  no ” said the bursar  “of course not  we all have our different
languages  but we all really mean the same thing ”

“has anyone discovered ” asked feverstone  “what  precisely  the
n i c e  is  or what it intends to do ”

curry looked at him with a slightly startled expression  “that comes
oddly from you  dick ” he said  “i thought you were in on it yourself ”

“isnt it a little naïve ” said feverstone  “to suppose that being in on
a thing involves any distinct knowledge of its official programme ”

“oh well  if you mean  details  ” said curry  and then stopped 

“surely  feverstone ” said busby  “youre making a great mystery about
nothing  i should have thought the objects of the n i c e  were pretty
clear  its the first attempt to take applied science seriously from the
national point of view  the difference in scale between it and anything
weve had before amounts to a difference in kind  the buildings alone 
the apparatus alone —think what it has done already for industry  think
how it is going to mobilise all the talent of the country  and not only
scientific talent in the narrower sense  fifteen departmental directors
at fifteen thousand a year each  its own legal staff  its own police 
im told  its own permanent staff of architects  surveyors  engineers 
the things stupendous ”

“careers for our sons ” said feverstone  “i see ”

“what do you mean by that  lord feverstone ” said busby  putting down
his glass 

“god ” said feverstone  his eyes laughing  “what a brick to drop  id
quite forgotten you had a family  james ”

“i agree with james ” said curry  who had been waiting somewhat
impatiently to speak  “the n i c e  marks the beginning of a new era—the
 really  scientific era  up to now everything has been haphazard  this
is going to put science itself on a scientific basis  there are to be
forty interlocking committees sitting every day and theyve got a
wonderful gadget—i was shown the model last time i was in town—by which
the findings of each committee print themselves off in their own little
compartment on the analytical notice-board every half-hour  then that
report slides itself into the right position where its connected up by
little arrows with all the relevant parts of the other reports  a glance
at the board shows you the policy of the whole institute actually taking
shape under your own eyes  therell be a staff of at least twenty
experts at the top of the building working this notice-board in a room
rather like the tube control rooms  its a marvellous gadget  the
different kinds of business all come out in the board in different
coloured lights  it must have cost half a million  they call it a
pragmatometer ”

“and there ” said busby  “you see again what the institute is already
doing for the country  pragmatometry is going to be a big thing 
hundreds of people are going in for it  why  this analytical
notice-board will probably be out of date before the building is
finished ”

“yes  by jove ” said feverstone  “and n o  himself told me this morning
that the sanitation of the institute was going to be something quite out
of the ordinary ”

“so it is ” said busby sturdily  “i dont see why one should think that
unimportant ”

“and what do you think about it  studdock ” said feverstone 

“i think ” said mark  “that james touched on the most important point
when he said that it would have its own legal staff and its own police 
i dont give a fig for pragmatometers and sanitation  de luxe   the real
thing is that this time were going to get science applied to social
problems and backed by the whole force of the state  just as war has
been backed by the whole force of the state in the past  one hopes  of
course  that itll find out more than the old free-lance science did 
but whats certain is that it can  do  more ”

“damn ” said curry  looking at his watch  “ill have to go and talk to
n o  now  if you people would like any brandy when youve finished your
wine  its in that cupboard  youll find balloon glasses on the shelf
above  ill be back as soon as i can  youre not going  james  are you ”

“yes ” said the bursar  “im going to bed early  dont let me break up
the party for you two  ive been on my legs nearly all day  you know  a
mans a fool to hold any office in this college  continual anxiety 
crushing responsibility  and then you get people suggesting that all the
little research-beetles who never poke their noses outside their
libraries and laboratories are the real workers  id like to see glossop
or any of that lot face the sort of days work ive had to-day  curry 
my lad  youd have had an easier life if youd stuck to economics ”

“ive told you before—” began curry  but the bursar  now risen  was
bending over lord feverstone and telling him a funny story 

as soon as the two men had got out of the room lord feverstone looked
steadily at mark for some seconds with an enigmatic expression  then he
chuckled  then the chuckle developed into a laugh  he threw his lean 
muscular body well back into his chair and laughed louder and louder  he
was very infectious in his laughter and mark found himself laughing
too—quite sincerely and even helplessly  like a child 
“pragmatometers—palatial lavatories—practical idealism ” gasped
feverstone  it was a moment of extraordinary liberation for mark  all
sorts of things about curry and busby which he had not previously
noticed  or else  noticing  had slurred over in his reverence for the
progressive element  came back to his mind  he wondered how he could
have been so blind to the funny side of them 

“it really is rather devastating ” said feverstone when he had partially
recovered  “that the people one has to use for getting things done
should talk such drivel the moment you ask them about the things
themselves ”

“and yet they  are   in a sense  the brains of bracton ” said mark 

“good lord  no  glossop and bill the blizzard and even old jewel have
ten times their intelligence ”

“i didnt know you took that view ”

“i think glossop etc  are quite mistaken  i think their idea of culture
and knowledge and what not is unrealistic  i dont think it fits the
world were living in  its a mere fantasy  but it is quite a clear idea
and they follow it out consistently  they know what they want  but our
two poor friends  though they can be persuaded to take the right train 
or even to drive it  havent a ghost of a notion where its going to  or
why  theyll sweat blood to bring the n i c e  to edgestow  thats why
theyre indispensable  but what the point of the n i c e  is  what the
point of anything is—ask them another  pragmatometry  fifteen
sub-directors ”

“well  perhaps im in the same boat myself ”

“not at all  you saw the point at once  i knew you would  ive read
everything youve written since you were in for your fellowship  thats
what i wanted to talk to you about ”

mark was silent  the giddy sensation of being suddenly whirled up from
one plane of secrecy to another  coupled with the growing effect of
currys excellent port  prevented him from speaking 

“i want you to come into the institute ” said feverstone 

“you mean—to leave bracton ”

“that makes no odds  anyway  i dont suppose theres anything you want
here  wed make curry warden when n o  retires and——”

“they were talking of making you warden ”

“god ” said feverstone  and stared  mark realised that from feverstones
point of view this was like the suggestion that he should become
headmaster of a small idiots school  and thanked his stars that his own
remark had not been uttered in a tone that made it obviously serious 
then they both laughed again 

“you ” said feverstone  “would be absolutely wasted as warden  thats
the job for curry  hell do it very well  you want a man who loves
business and wire-pulling for their own sake and doesnt really ask what
its all about  if he did  hed start bringing in his own—well  i
suppose hed call them ideas  as it is  weve only got to tell him
that he thinks so-and-so is a man the college wants  and he  will  think
it  and then hell never rest till so-and-so gets a fellowship  thats
what we want the college for  a drag net  a recruiting office ”

“a recruiting office for the n i c e   you mean ”

“yes  in the first instance  but its only one part of the general
show ”

“im not sure that i know what you mean ”

“you soon will  the home side  and all that  you know  it sounds rather
in busbys style to say that humanity is at the cross-roads  but it is
the main question at the moment  which side ones on—obscurantism or
order  it does really look as if we now had the power to dig ourselves
in as a species for a pretty staggering period  to take control of our
own destiny  if science is really given a free hand it can now take over
the human race and recondition it  make man a really efficient animal 
if it doesnt—well  were done ”

“go on ”

“there are three main problems  first  the interplanetary problem ”

“what on earth do you mean ”

“well  that doesnt really matter  we cant do anything about that at
present  the only man who could help was weston ”

“he was killed in a blitz  wasnt he ”

“he was murdered ”

“murdered ”

“im pretty sure of it  and ive a shrewd idea who the murderer was ”

“good god  can nothing be done ”

“theres no evidence  the murderer is a respectable cambridge don with
weak eyes  a game leg  and a fair beard  hes dined in this college ”

“what was weston murdered for ”

“for being on our side  the murderer is one of the enemy ”

“you dont mean to say he murdered him for that ”

“yes ” said feverstone  bringing his hand down smartly on the table 
“thats just the point  youll hear people like curry or james burbling
away about the war against reaction  it never enters their heads that
it might be a real war with real casualties  they think the violent
resistance of the other side ended with the persecution of galileo and
all that  but dont believe it  it is just seriously beginning  they
know now that we have at last got  real  powers  that the question of
what humanity is to be is going to be decided in the next sixty years 
theyre going to fight every inch  theyll stop at nothing ”

“they cant win ” said mark 

“well hope not ” said lord feverstone  “i think they cant  that is why
it is of such immense importance to each of us to choose the right side 
if you try to be neutral you become simply a pawn ”

“oh  i havent any doubt which is  my  side ” said mark  “hang it
all—the preservation of the human race—its a pretty rock-bottom
obligation ”

“well  personally ” said feverstone  “im not indulging in any busbyisms
about that  its a little fantastic to base ones actions on a supposed
concern for whats going to happen millions of years hence  and you must
remember that the other side would claim to be preserving humanity too 
both can be explained psycho-analytically if they take that line  the
practical point is that you and i dont like being pawns  and we do
rather like fighting—specially on the winning side ”

“and what is the first practical step ”

“yes  thats the real question  as i said  the interplanetary problem
must be left on one side for the moment  the second problem is our
rivals on this planet  i dont mean only insects and bacteria  theres
far too much life of every kind about  animal and vegetable  we havent
really cleared the place yet  first we couldnt  and then we had
aesthetic and humanitarian scruples  and we still havent
short-circuited the question of the balance of nature  all that is to be
gone into  the third problem is man himself ”

“go on  this interests me very much ”

“man has got to take charge of man  that means  remember  that some men
have got to take charge of the rest—which is another reason for cashing
in on it as soon as one can  you and i want to be the people who do the
taking charge  not the ones who are taken charge of  quite ”

“what sort of thing have you in mind ”

“quite simple and obvious things  at first—sterilisation of the unfit 
liquidation of backward races  we dont want any dead weights  
selective breeding  then real education  including pre-natal education 
by real education i mean one that has no take-it-or-leave-it nonsense 
a real education makes the patient what it wants infallibly  whatever he
or his parents try to do about it  of course  itll have to be mainly
psychological at first  but well get on to biochemical conditioning in
the end and direct manipulation of the brain ”

“but this is stupendous  feverstone ”

“its the real thing at last  a new type of man  and its people like
you whove got to begin to make him ”

“thats my trouble  dont think its false modesty  but i havent yet
seen how i can contribute ”

“no  but  we  have  you are what we need  a trained sociologist with a
radically realistic outlook  not afraid of responsibility  also  a
sociologist who can write ”

“you dont mean you want me to write up all this ”

“no  we want you to write it  down —to camouflage it  only for the
present  of course  once the thing gets going we shant have to bother
about the great heart of the british public  well make the great heart
what we want it to be  but in the meantime it  does  make a difference
how things are put  for instance  if it were even whispered that the
n i c e  wanted powers to experiment on criminals  youd have all the
old women of both sexes up in arms and yapping about humanity  call it
re-education of the mal-adjusted and you have them all slobbering with
delight that the brutal era of retributive punishment has at last come
to an end  odd thing it is—the word experiment is unpopular  but not
the word experimental  you mustnt experiment on children  but offer
the dear little kiddies free education in an experimental school
attached to the n i c e  and its all correct ”

“you dont mean that this—er—journalistic side would be my main job ”

“its nothing to do with journalism  your readers in the first instance
would be committees of the house of commons  not the public  but that
would only be a side line  as for the job itself—why  its impossible to
say how it might develop  talking to a man like you  i dont stress the
financial side  youd start at something quite modest  say about fifteen
hundred a year ”

“i wasnt thinking about that ” said mark  flushing with pure
excitement 

“of course ” said feverstone  “i ought to warn you  there is the danger 
not yet  perhaps  but when things really begin to hum its quite on the
cards they may try to bump you off  like poor old weston ”

“i dont think i was thinking about that either ” said mark 

“look here ” said feverstone  “let me run you across to-morrow to see
john wither  he told me to bring you for the week-end if you were
interested  youll meet all the important people there  and itll give
you a chance to make up your mind ”

“how does wither come into it  i thought jules was the head of the
n i c e ” jules was a distinguished novelist and scientific populariser
whose name always appeared before the public in connection with the new
institute 

“jules  hells bells ” said feverstone  “you dont imagine that little
mascot has anything to say to what really goes on  hes all right for
selling the institute to the great british public in the sunday papers
and he draws a whacking salary  hes no use for work  theres nothing
inside his head except some nineteenth-century socialist stuff  and blah
about the rights of man  hes just about got as far as darwin ”

“oh quite ” said mark  “i was always rather puzzled at his being in the
show at all  do you know  since youre so kind  i think id better
accept your offer and go over to withers for the week-end  what time
would you be starting ”

“about quarter to eleven  they tell me you live out sandown way  i could
call and pick you up ”

“thanks very much  now tell me about wither ”

“john wither ” began feverstone  but suddenly broke off  “damn ” he
said  “here comes curry  now we shall have to hear everything n o  said
and how wonderfully the arch-politician has managed him  dont run away 
i shall need your moral support ”


                                   ii

the last bus had gone long before mark left college  and he walked home
up the hill in brilliant moonlight  something happened to him the moment
he had let himself into the flat which was very unusual  he found
himself  on the door-mat  embracing a frightened  half-sobbing jane—even
a humble jane  who was saying  “oh  mark  ive been so frightened ”

there was a quality in the very muscles of his wifes body which took
him by surprise  a certain indefinable defensiveness had momentarily
deserted her  he had known such occasions before  but they were rare 
they were already becoming rarer  and they tended  in his experience  to
be followed next day by inexplicable quarrels  this puzzled him greatly 
but he had never put his bewilderment into words 

it is doubtful whether he could have understood her feelings even if
they had been explained to him  and jane  in any case  could not have
explained them  she was in extreme confusion  but the reasons for her
unusual behaviour on this particular evening were simple enough  she had
got back from the dimbles at about half-past four  feeling much
exhilarated by her walk and hungry  and quite sure that her experiences
on the previous night and at lunch were over and done with  she had had
to light up and draw the curtains before she had finished tea  for the
days were getting short  while doing so the thought had come into her
mind that her fright at the dream and at the mere mention of a mantle 
an old man  an old man buried but not dead  and a language like spanish 
had really been as irrational as a childs fear of the dark  this had
led her to remember moments when she had feared the dark as a child 
perhaps she allowed herself to remember them too long  at any rate  when
she sat down to drink her last cup of tea  the evening had somehow
deteriorated  it never recovered  first she found it rather difficult to
keep her mind on her book  then  when she had acknowledged this
difficulty  she found it difficult to fix on any book  then she realised
that she was restless  from being restless she became nervous  then
followed a long time when she was not frightened  but knew that she
would be very frightened indeed if she did not keep herself in hand 
then came a curious reluctance to go into the kitchen to get herself
some supper  and a difficulty—indeed an impossibility—of eating anything
when she had got it  and now there was no disguising the fact that she
was frightened  in desperation she rang up the dimbles  “i think i might
go and see the person you suggested  after all ” she said  mrs  dimbles
voice came back  after a curious little pause  giving her the address 
ironwood was the name  miss ironwood  apparently  jane had assumed it
would be a man and was rather repelled  miss ironwood lived out at st 
annes on the hill  jane asked if she should make an appointment  “no ”
said mrs  dimble  “theyll be—you neednt make an appointment ” jane
kept the conversation going as long as she could  she had rung up not
chiefly to get the address but to hear mother dimbles voice  secretly
she had had a wild hope that mother dimble would recognise her distress
and say at once  “ill come straight up to you by car ” instead  she got
the mere information and a hurried “good night ” it seemed to jane that
there was something queer about mrs  dimbles voice  she felt that by
ringing up she had interrupted a conversation about herself  or no—not
about herself but about something else more important  with which she
was somehow connected  and what had mrs  dimble meant by “theyll be ”
“theyll be expecting you ” horrible  childish night-nursery visions of
 they  “expecting her” passed before her mind  she saw miss ironwood 
dressed all in black  sitting with her hands folded on her knees and
then someone leading her into miss ironwoods presence and saying “shes
come” and leaving her there 

“damn the dimbles ” said jane to herself  and then unsaid it  more in
fear than in remorse  and now that the life-line had been used and
brought no comfort  the terror  as if insulted by her futile attempt to
escape it  rushed back on her with no possibility of disguise  and she
could never afterwards remember whether the horrible old man and the
mantle had actually appeared to her in a dream or whether she had merely
sat there  huddled and wild-eyed  hoping  hoping  hoping  even praying 
though she believed in no one to pray to  that they would not 

and that is why mark found such an unexpected jane on the door-mat  it
was a pity  he thought  that this should have happened on a night when
he was so late and so tired and  to tell the truth  not perfectly sober 


                                  iii

“do you feel quite all right this morning ” said mark 

“yes  thank you ” said jane shortly 

mark was lying in bed and drinking a cup of tea  jane was seated at the
dressing-table  partially dressed  and doing her hair  marks eyes
rested on her with indolent  early morning pleasure  if he guessed very
little of the maladjustment between them this was partly due to our
races incurable habit of “projection ” we think the lamb gentle because
its wool is soft to our hands  men call a woman voluptuous when she
arouses voluptuous feelings in them  janes body  soft though firm and
slim though rounded  was so exactly to marks mind that it was all but
impossible for him not to attribute to her the same sensations which she
excited in him 

“youre quite sure youre all right ” he asked again 

“quite ” said jane  more shortly still 

jane thought she was annoyed because her hair was not going up to her
liking and because mark was fussing  she also knew  of course  that she
was deeply angry with herself for the collapse which had betrayed her
last night  into being what she most detested—the fluttering  tearful
“little woman” of sentimental fiction running for comfort to male arms 
but she thought this anger was only in the back of her mind  and had no
suspicion that it was pulsing through every vein and producing at that
very moment the clumsiness in her fingers which made her hair seem
intractable 

“because ” continued mark  “if you felt the least bit uncomfortable  i
 could  put off going to see this man wither ”

jane said nothing 

“if i did go ” said mark  “id certainly have to be away for the night 
perhaps two ”

jane closed her lips a little more firmly and still said nothing 

“supposing i did ” said mark  “you wouldnt think of asking myrtle over
to stay ”

“no thank you ” said jane emphatically  and then  “im quite accustomed
to being alone ”

“i know ” said mark in a rather defensive voice  “thats the devil of
the way things are in college at present  thats one of the chief
reasons im thinking of another job ”

jane was still silent 

“look here  old thing ” said mark  suddenly sitting up and throwing his
legs out of bed  “theres no good beating about the bush  i dont feel
comfortable about going away while youre in your present state——”

“what state ” said jane  turning round and facing him for the first
time 

“well—i mean—just a bit nervy—as anyone may be temporarily ”

“because i happened to be having a nightmare when you came home last
night—or rather this morning—theres no need to talk as if i was a
neurasthenic ” this was not in the least what jane had intended or
expected to say 

“now theres no good going on like that      ” began mark 

“like what ” said jane loudly  and then  before he had time to reply 
“if youve decided that im going mad youd better get brizeacre to come
down and certify me  it would be convenient to do it while youre away 
they could get me packed off while you are at mr  withers without any
fuss  im going to see about the breakfast now  if you dont shave and
dress pretty quickly  youll not be ready when lord feverstone calls ”

the upshot of it was that mark gave himself a very bad cut while shaving
 and saw  at once  a picture of himself talking to the all-important
wither with a great blob of cotton wool on his upper lip   while jane
decided  from a mixture of motives  to cook mark an unusually elaborate
breakfast—of which she would rather die than eat any herself—and did so
with the swift efficiency of an angry woman  only to upset it all over
the new stove at the last moment  they were still at the table and both
pretending to read newspapers when lord feverstone arrived  most
unfortunately mrs  maggs arrived at the same moment  mrs  maggs was that
element in janes economy represented by the phrase “i have a woman who
comes in twice a week ” twenty years earlier janes mother would have
addressed such a functionary as “maggs” and been addressed by her as
“mum ” but jane and her “woman who came in” called one another mrs 
maggs and mrs  studdock  they were about the same age and to a
bachelors eye there was no very noticeable difference in the clothes
they wore  it was therefore perhaps not inexcusable that when mark
attempted to introduce feverstone to his wife feverstone should have
shaken mrs  maggs by the hand  but it did not sweeten the last few
minutes before the two men departed 

jane left the flat under pretence of shopping almost at once  “i really
couldnt stand mrs  maggs to-day ” she said to herself  “shes a
terrible talker ” so that was lord feverstone—that man with the loud 
unnatural laugh and the mouth like a shark  and no manners  apparently a
perfect fool  too  what good could it do mark to go about with a man
like that  jane had distrusted his face  she could always tell—there was
something shifty about him  probably he was making a fool of mark  mark
was so easily taken in  if only he wasnt at bracton  it was a horrible
college  what did mark see in people like mr  curry and the odious old
clergyman with the beard  and meanwhile  what of the day that awaited
her  and the night  and the next night  and beyond that—for when men say
they may be away for two nights it means that two nights is the minimum
and they hope to be away for a week  a telegram  never a trunk call 
puts it all right as far as they are concerned 

she must do something  she even thought of following marks advice and
getting myrtle to come and stay  but myrtle was her sister-in-law 
marks twin sister  with much too much of the adoring sisters attitude
to the brilliant brother  she would talk about marks health and his
shirts and socks with a continual undercurrent of unexpressed yet
unmistakable astonishment at janes good luck in marrying him  no 
certainly not myrtle  then she thought of going to see dr  brizeacre as
a patient  he was a bracton man and would therefore probably charge her
nothing  but when she came to think of answering  to brizeacre of all
people  the sort of questions which brizeacre would certainly ask  this
turned out to be impossible  she must do something  in the end  somewhat
to her own surprise  she found that she had decided to go out to st 
annes and see miss ironwood  she thought herself a fool for doing so 


                                   iv

an observer placed at the right altitude above edgestow that day might
have seen far to the south a moving spot on a main road  and later  to
the east  much nearer the silver thread of the wynd  and much more
slowly moving  the smoke of a train 

the spot would have been the car which was carrying mark studdock
towards the blood transfusion office at belbury  where the nucleus of
the n i c e  had taken up its temporary abode  the very size and style
of the car had made a favourable impression on him the moment he saw it 
the upholstery was of such quality that one felt it ought to be good to
eat  and what fine  male energy  mark felt sick of women at the moment 
revealed itself in the very gestures with which feverstone settled
himself at the wheel and put his elbow on the horn  and clasped his pipe
firmly between his teeth  the speed of the car  even in the narrow
streets of edgestow  was impressive  and so were the laconic criticisms
of feverstone on other drivers and pedestrians  once over the level
crossing and beyond janes old college  st  elizabeths  he began to
show what his car could do  their speed became so great that even on a
rather empty road the inexcusably bad drivers  the manifestly
half-witted pedestrians and men with horses  the hen that they actually
ran over and the dogs and hens that feverstone pronounced “damned
lucky ” seemed to follow one another almost without intermission 
telegraph posts raced by  bridges rushed overhead with a roar  villages
streamed backward to join the country already devoured  and mark  drunk
with air and at once fascinated and repelled by the insolence of
feverstones driving  sat saying “yes” and “quite” and “it was  their 
fault ” and stealing sidelong glances at his companion  certainly  he
was a change from the fussy importance of curry and the bursar  the
long  straight nose and the clenched teeth  the hard bony outlines
beneath the face  the very way he wore his clothes  all spoke of a big
man driving a big car to somewhere where they would find big stuff going
on  and he  mark  was to be in it all  at one or two moments when his
heart came into his mouth he wondered whether the quality of lord
feverstones driving quite justified its speed 

“you need never take a cross-road like that seriously ” yelled
feverstone  as they plunged on after the narrowest of these escapes 

“quite ” bawled mark  “no good making a fetish of them ”

“drive much yourself ” said feverstone 

“used to a good deal ” said mark 

the smoke which our imaginary observer might have seen to the east of
edgestow would have indicated the train in which jane studdock was
progressing slowly towards the village of st  annes  edgestow itself 
for those who had reached it from london  had all the appearances of a
terminus  but if you looked about you  you might see presently  in a
bay  a little train of two or three coaches and a tank engine—a train
that sizzled and exuded steam from beneath the footboards and in which
most of the passengers seemed to know one another  on some days  instead
of the third coach  there might be a horse-box  and on the platform
there would be hampers containing dead rabbits or live poultry  and men
in brown bowler hats and gaiters  and perhaps a terrier or a sheep-dog
that seemed to be used to travelling  in this train  which started at
half-past one  jane jerked and rattled along an embankment whence she
looked down through some bare branches and some branches freckled with
red and yellow leaves into bragdon wood itself and thence through the
cutting and over the level-crossing at bragdon camp and along the edge
of brawl park  the great house was just visible at one point  and so to
the first stop at dukes eaton  here  as at woolham and cure hardy and
fourstones  the train settled back  when it stopped  with a little jerk
and something like a sigh  and then there would be a noise of milk cans
rolling and coarse boots treading on the platform and after that a pause
which seemed to last long  during which the autumn sunlight grew warm on
the window-pane and smells of wood and field from beyond the tiny
station floated in and seemed to claim the railway as part of the land 
passengers got in and out of her carriage at every stop  apple-faced
men  and women with elastic-side boots and imitation fruit on their
hats  and schoolboys  jane hardly noticed them  for though she was
theoretically an extreme democrat  no social class save her own had yet
become a reality to her in any place except the printed page  and in
between the stations things flitted past  so isolated from their context
that each seemed to promise some unearthly happiness if one could but
have descended from the train at that very moment to seize it  a house
backed with a group of haystacks and wide brown fields about it  two
aged horses standing head to tail  a little orchard with washing hanging
on a line  and a rabbit staring at the train  whose two eyes looked like
the dots  and his ears like the uprights  of a double exclamation mark 
at quarter-past two she came to st  annes  which was the real terminus
of the branch  and the end of everything  the air struck her as cold and
tonic when she left the station 

although the train had been chugging and wheezing up-hill for the latter
half of her journey there was still a climb to be done on foot  for st 
annes is one of those villages perched on a hilltop which are commoner
in ireland than in england  and the station is some way from the
village  a winding road between high banks led her up to it  as soon as
she had passed the church she turned left  as she had been instructed 
at the saxon cross  there were no houses on her left—only a row of beech
trees and unfenced ploughland falling steeply away  and beyond that the
timbered midland plain spreading as far as she could see and blue in the
distance  she was on the highest ground in all that region  presently
she came to a high wall on her right that seemed to run on for a great
way  there was a door in it and beside the door an old iron bell-pull  a
kind of flatness of spirit was on her  she felt sure she had come on a
fools errand  nevertheless she rang  when the jangling noise had ceased
there followed a silence so long  and in that upland place so chilly 
that jane began to wonder whether the house were inhabited  then  just
as she was debating whether to ring again or to turn away  she heard the
noise of someones feet approaching briskly on the inside of the wall 

meanwhile lord feverstones car had long since arrived at belbury—a
florid edwardian mansion which had been built for a millionaire who
admired versailles  at the sides it seemed to have sprouted into a
widespread outgrowth of newer and lower buildings in cement  which
housed the blood transfusion office 




                                 three
                   belbury and st  annes-on-the-hill 


                                   i

on his way up the wide staircase mark caught sight of himself and his
companion in a mirror  feverstone looked  as always  master of his
clothes  his face  and of the whole situation  the blob of cotton wool
on marks upper lip had been blown awry during the journey  so that it
looked like one half of a fiercely upturned false moustache and revealed
a patch of blackened blood beneath it  a moment later he found himself
in a big-windowed room with a blazing fire  being introduced to mr  john
wither  deputy director of the n i c e 

wither was a white-haired old man with a courtly manner  his face was
clean shaven and very large indeed  with watery blue eyes and something
rather vague and chaotic about it  he did not appear to be giving them
his whole attention  and this impression must  i think  have been due to
the eyes  for his actual words and gestures were polite to the point of
effusiveness  he said it was a great  a very great pleasure  to welcome
mr  studdock among them  it added to the deep obligations under which
lord feverstone had already laid him  he hoped they had had an agreeable
journey  mr  wither appeared to be under the impression that they had
come by air and  when this was corrected  that they had come from london
by train  then he began enquiring whether mr  studdock found his
quarters perfectly comfortable and had to be reminded that they had only
that moment arrived  “i suppose ” thought mark  “the old chap is trying
to put me at my ease ” in fact  mr  withers conversation was having
precisely the opposite effect  mark wished he would offer him a
cigarette  his growing conviction that this man really knew nothing
about him  and even that all the well-knit schemes and promises of
feverstone were at this moment dissolving into some sort of mist  was
extremely uncomfortable  at last he took his courage in both hands and
endeavoured to bring mr  wither to the point by saying that he was still
not quite clear in what capacity he would be able to assist the
institute 

“i assure you  mr  studdock ” said the deputy director with an unusually
far-away look in his eye  “that you neednt anticipate the slightest      
er       the slightest difficulty on that point  there was never any
idea of circumscribing your activities and your general influence on
policy  much less your relations with your colleagues and what i might
call in general the terms of reference under which you would be
collaborating with us  without the fullest possible consideration of
your own views and  indeed  your own advice  you will find us  mr 
studdock  if i might express myself in that way  a very happy family ”

“oh  dont misunderstand me  sir ” said mark  “i didnt mean that at
all  i only meant that i felt i should like some sort of idea of what
exactly i should be doing if i came to you ”

“well now  when you speak of coming to us ” said the deputy director 
“that raises a point on which i hope there is no misunderstanding  i
think we all agreed that no question of residence need be raised—i mean 
at this stage  we thought  we all thought  that you should be left
entirely free to carry on your work wherever you pleased  if you cared
to live in london or cambridge——”

“edgestow ” prompted lord feverstone 

“ah yes  edgestow ” here the deputy director turned round and addressed
feverstone  “i was just explaining to mr        er       studdock  and i
feel sure you will fully agree with me  that nothing was further from
the mind of the committee than to dictate in any way  or even to advise 
where mr  —— where your friend should live  of course  wherever he lives
we should naturally place air transport and road transport at his
disposal  i dare say  lord feverstone  you have already explained to him
that he will find that all questions of that sort will adjust themselves
without the smallest difficulty ”

“really  sir ” said mark  “i wasnt thinking about that at all  i
havent—i mean i shouldnt have the smallest objection to living
anywhere  i only——”

the deputy director interrupted him  if anything so gentle as withers
voice can be called an interruption  “but i assure you  mr        er      
i assure you  sir  that there is not the smallest objection to your
residing wherever you may find convenient  there was never  at any
stage  the slightest suggestion——” but here mark  almost in desperation 
ventured to interrupt himself 

“it is the exact nature of the work ” he said  “and of my qualifications
for it that i wanted to get clear ”

“my dear friend ” said the deputy director  “you need not have the
slightest uneasiness in that direction  as i said before  you will find
us a very happy family  and may feel perfectly satisfied that no
questions as to your entire suitability have been agitating anyones
mind in the least  i should not be offering you a position among us if
there were the slightest danger of your not being completely welcome to
all  or the least suspicion that your very valuable qualities were not
fully appreciated  you are—you are among  friends  here  mr  studdock  i
should be the last person to advise you to connect yourself with any
organisation where you ran the risk of being exposed       er       to
disagreeable personal contacts ”

mark did not ask again in so many words what the n i c e  wanted him to
do  partly because he began to be afraid that he was supposed to know
this already  and partly because a perfectly direct question would have
sounded a crudity in that room—a crudity which might suddenly exclude
him from the warm and almost drugged atmosphere of vague  yet heavily
important  confidence in which he was gradually being enfolded 

“you are very kind ” he said  “the only thing i should like to get just
a little clearer is the exact—well  the exact scope of the appointment ”

“well ” said mr  wither in a voice so low and rich that it was almost a
sigh  “i am very glad you have raised that issue now in a quite informal
way  obviously neither you nor i would wish to commit ourselves  in this
room  in any sense which was at all injurious to the powers of the
committee  i quite understand your motives and       er       respect
them  we are not  of course  speaking of an appointment in the
quasi-technical sense of the term  it would be improper for both of us
 though  you may well remind me  in different ways  to do so—or at least
it might lead to certain inconveniences  but i think i can most
definitely assure you that nobody wants to force you into any kind of
strait-waistcoat or bed of procrustes  we do not really think  among
ourselves  in terms of strictly demarcated functions  of course  i take
it that men like you and me are—well  to put it frankly  hardly in the
habit of using concepts of that type  everyone in the institute feels
that his own work is not so much a departmental contribution to an end
already defined as a moment or grade in the progressive self-definition
of an organic whole ”

and mark said—god forgive him  for he was young and shy and vain and
timid all in one—“i do think that is so important  the elasticity of
your organisation is one of the things that attracts me ” after that  he
had no further chance of bringing the director to the point  and
whenever the slow  gentle voice ceased he found himself answering it in
its own style  and apparently helpless to do otherwise despite the
torturing recurrence of the question  “what are we both talking
 about  ” at the very end of the interview there came one moment of
clarity  mr  wither supposed that he  mark  would find it convenient to
join the n i c e  club  even for the next few days he would be freer as
a member than as someones guest  mark agreed and then flushed crimson
like a small boy on learning that the easiest course was to become a
life member at the cost of £200  he had not that amount in the bank  of
course  if he had got the new job with its fifteen hundred a year  all
would be well  but had he got it  was there a job at all 

“how silly ” he said aloud  “i havent got my cheque-book with me ”

a moment later he found himself on the stairs with feverstone 

“well ” asked mark eagerly  feverstone did not seem to hear him 

“well ” repeated mark  “when shall i know my fate  i mean  have i got
the job ”

“hullo  guy ” bawled feverstone suddenly to a man in the hall beneath 
next moment he had trotted down to the foot of the stairs  grasped his
friend warmly by the hand  and disappeared  mark  following him more
slowly  found himself in the hall  silent  alone  and self-conscious 
among the groups and pairs of chattering men  who were all crossing it
towards the big folding doors on his left 


                                   ii

it seemed to last long  this standing  this wondering what to do  this
effort to look natural and not to catch the eyes of strangers  the noise
and the agreeable smells which came from the folding doors made it
obvious that people were going to lunch  mark hesitated  uncertain of
his own status  in the end he decided that he couldnt stand there
looking like a fool any longer  and went in 

he had hoped that there would be several small tables at one of which he
could have sat alone  but there was only a single long table  already so
nearly filled that  after looking in vain for feverstone  he had to sit
down beside a stranger  “i suppose one sits where one likes ” he
murmured as he did so  but the stranger apparently did not hear  he was
a bustling sort of man who was eating very quickly and talking at the
same time to his neighbour on the other side 

“thats just it ” he was saying  “as i told him  it makes no difference
to me which way they settle it  ive no objection to the i j p  people
taking over the whole thing if thats what the d d  wants  but what i
dislike is one man being responsible for it when half the work is being
done by someone else  as i said to him  youve now got three h d s all
tumbling over one another about some job that could really be done by a
clerk  its becoming ridiculous  look at what happened this morning ”
conversation on these lines continued throughout the meal 

although the food and the drinks were excellent  it was a relief to mark
when people began getting up from table  following the general movement 
he recrossed the hall and came into a large room furnished as a lounge
where coffee was being served  here at last he saw feverstone  indeed it
would have been difficult not to notice him  for he was the centre of a
group and laughing prodigiously  mark wished to approach him  if only to
find out whether he were expected to stay the night and  if so  whether
a room had been assigned to him  but the knot of men round feverstone
was of that confidential kind which it is difficult to join  he moved
towards one of the many tables and began turning over the glossy pages
of an illustrated weekly  every few seconds he looked up to see if there
were any chance of getting a word with feverstone alone  the fifth time
he did so  he found himself looking into the face of one of his own
colleagues  a fellow of bracton  called william hingest  the progressive
element called him  though not to his face  bill the blizzard 

hingest had not  as curry anticipated  been present at the college
meeting  and was hardly on speaking terms with lord feverstone  mark
realised with a certain awe that here was a man  directly  in touch with
the n i c e —one who started  so to speak  at a point beyond feverstone 
hingest  who was a physical chemist  was one of the two scientists at
bracton who had a reputation outside england  i hope the reader has not
been misled into supposing that the fellows of bracton were a specially
distinguished body  it was certainly not the intention of the
progressive element to elect mediocrities to fellowships  but their
determination to elect “sound men” cruelly limited their field of choice
and  as busby had once said  “you cant have everything ” bill the
blizzard had an old-fashioned curly moustache in which white had almost 
but not completely  triumphed over yellow  a large beak-like nose  and a
bald head 

“this is an unexpected pleasure ” said mark with a hint of formality  he
was always a little afraid of hingest 

“huh ” grunted bill  “eh  oh  its you  studdock  didnt know theyd
secured your services here ”

“i was sorry not to see you at the college meeting yesterday ” said
mark 

this was a lie  the progressive element always found hingests presence
an embarrassment  as a scientist—and the only really eminent scientist
they had—he was their rightful property  but he was that hateful
anomaly  the wrong sort of scientist  glossop  who was a classic  was
his chief friend in college  he had the air  the “affectation” curry
called it  of not attaching much importance to his own revolutionary
discoveries in chemistry and of valuing himself much more on being a
hingest  the family was of almost mythical antiquity  “never
contaminated” as its nineteenth century historian had said  “by traitor 
placeman  or baronetcy ” he had given particular offence on the occasion
of de broglies visit to edgestow  the frenchman had spent his spare
time exclusively in bill the blizzards society  but when an
enthusiastic junior fellow had thrown out a feeler about the rich feast
of science which the two  savants  must have shared  bill the blizzard
had appeared to search his memory for a moment and then replied that he
didnt think they had got on to that subject  “gassing almanac de gotha
nonsense  i suppose ” was currys comment  though not in hingests
presence 

“eh  whats that  college meeting ” said the blizzard  “what were they
talking about ”

“about the sale of bragdon wood ”

“all nonsense ” muttered the blizzard 

“i hope you would have agreed with the decision we came to ”

“it made no difference what decision they came to ”

“oh ” said mark with some surprise 

“it was all nonsense  the n i c e  would have had the wood in any case 
they had powers to compel a sale ”

“what an extraordinary thing  i was given to understand they were going
to cambridge if we didnt sell ”

“not a word of truth in it  as to its being an extraordinary thing  that
depends on what you mean  theres nothing extraordinary in the fellows
of bracton talking all afternoon about an unreal issue  and theres
nothing extraordinary in the fact that the n i c e  should wish  if
possible  to hand over to bracton the odium of turning the heart of
england into a cross between an abortive american hotel and a glorified
gas-works  the only real puzzle is why the n i c e  should want that bit
of land ”

“i suppose we shall find out as things go on ”

“you may  i shant ”

“oh ” said mark interrogatively 

“ive had enough of it ” said hingest  lowering his voice  “im leaving
to-night  i dont know what you were doing at bracton  but if it was any
good id advise you to go back and stick to it ”

“really ” said mark  “why do you say that ”

“doesnt matter for an old fellow like me ” said hingest  “but they
could play the devil with  you   of course it all depends on what a man
likes ”

“as a matter of fact ” said mark  “i havent fully made up my mind ” he
had been taught to regard hingest as a warped reactionary  “i dont even
know yet what my job would be if i stayed ”

“whats your subject ”

“sociology ”

“huh ” said hingest  “in that case i can soon point you out the man
youd be under  a fellow called steele  over there by the window  do you
see ”

“perhaps you could introduce me ”

“youre determined to stay then ”

“well  i suppose i ought at least to see him ”

“all right ” said hingest  “no business of mine ” then he added in a
louder voice  “steele ”

steele turned round  he was a tall  unsmiling man with that kind of face
which  though long and horse-like  has nevertheless rather thick and
pouting lips 

“this is studdock ” said hingest  “the new man for your department ”
then he turned away 

“oh ” said steele  then after a pause  “did he say  my  department ”

“thats what he  said  ” replied mark with an attempt at a smile  “but
perhaps hes got it wrong  im supposed to be a sociologist—if that
throws any light on it ”

“im h d  for sociology all right ” said steele  “but this is the first
ive heard about you  who told you you were to be there ”

“well  as a matter of fact ” said mark  “the whole thing is rather
vague  ive just had a talk with the deputy director but we didnt
actually go into any details ”

“how did you manage to see  him  ”

“lord feverstone introduced me ”

steele whistled  “i say  cosser ” he called out to a freckle-faced man
who was passing by  “listen to this  feverstone has just unloaded this
chap on our department  taken him straight to the d d  without saying a
word to me about it  what do you think of that ”

“well im damned ” said cosser  hardly glancing at mark but looking very
hard at steele 

“im sorry ” said mark  a little more loudly and a little more stiffly
than he had yet spoken  “dont be alarmed  i seem to have been put in
rather a false position  there must have been some misunderstanding  as
a matter of fact i am  at the moment  merely having a look round  im
not at all certain that i intend to stay in any case ”

neither of the other two took any notice of this last suggestion 

“thats feverstone all over ” said cosser to steele 

steele turned to mark  “i shouldnt advise you to take much notice of
what lord feverstone says here ” he remarked  “this isnt his business
at all ”

“all i object to ” said mark  wishing that he could prevent his face
from turning so red  “is being put in a false position  i only came over
as an experiment  it is a matter of indifference to me whether i take a
job in the n i c e  or not ”

“you see ” said steele to cosser  “there isnt really any room for a man
in our show—specially for someone who doesnt know the work  unless they
put him on the u l ”

“thats right ” said cosser 

“mr  studdock  i think ” said a new voice at marks elbow  a treble
voice which seemed disproportionate to the huge hill of a man whom he
saw when he turned his head  he recognised the speaker at once  his
dark  smooth face and black hair were unmistakable  and so was the
foreign accent  this was professor filostrato  the great physiologist 
whom mark had sat next to at a dinner about two years before  he was fat
to that degree which is comic on the stage  but the effect was not funny
in real life  mark was charmed that such a man should have remembered
him 

“i am very glad you have come to join us ” said filostrato  taking hold
of marks arm and gently piloting him away from steele and cosser 

“to tell you the truth ” said mark  “im not sure that i have  i was
brought over by feverstone but he has disappeared  and steele—id have
been in his department i suppose—doesnt seem to know anything about
me ”

“bah  steele ” said the professor  “that is all a bagatelle  he get too
big for his boots  he will be put in his place one of these days  it may
be you who will put him  i have read all your work   si si   do not
consider him ”

“i have a strong objection to being put in a false position——” began
mark 

“listen  my friend ” interrupted filostrato  “you must put all such
ideas out of your head  the first thing to realise is that the n i c e 
is serious  it is nothing less than the existence of the human race that
depends on our work  our  real  work  you comprehend  you will find
frictions and impertinences among this  canaglia   this rabble  they are
no more to be regarded than your dislike of a brother officer when the
battle is at his crisis ”

“as long as im given something to do that is worth doing ” said mark 
“i shouldnt allow anything of that sort to interfere with it ”

“yes  yes  that is right  the work is more important than you can yet
understand  you will see  these steeles and feverstones—they are of no
consequence  as long as you have the good will of the deputy director
you snap your fingers at them  you need listen to no one but him  you
comprehend  ah—and there is one other  do not have the fairy for your
enemy  for the rest—you laugh at them ”

“the fairy ”

“yes  her they call the fairy  oh  my god  a terrible  inglesaccia   she
is the head of our police  the institutional police   ecco   she come  i
will present you  miss hardcastle  permit that i present to you mr 
studdock ”

mark found himself writhing from the stokers or carters hand-grip of a
big woman in a black  short-skirted uniform  despite a bust that would
have done credit to a victorian barmaid  she was rather thickly built
than fat and her iron-grey hair was cropped short  her face was square 
stern  and pale  and her voice deep  a smudge of lip-stick laid on with
violent inattention to the real shape of her mouth was her only
concession to fashion  and she rolled or chewed a long black cheroot 
unlit  between her teeth  as she talked she had a habit of removing
this  staring intently at the mixture of lip-stick and saliva on its
mangled end  and then replacing it more firmly than before  she sat down
immediately in a chair close to where mark was standing  flung her right
leg over one of the arms  and fixed him with a gaze of cold intimacy 


                                  iii

 click—clack   distinct in the silence  where jane stood waiting  came
the tread of the person on the other side of the wall  then the door
opened and jane found herself facing a tall woman of about her own age 
this person looked at her with keen  non-committal eyes 

“does a miss ironwood live here ” said jane 

“yes ” said the other girl  neither opening the door any further nor
standing aside 

“i want to see her  please ” said jane 

“have you an appointment ” said the tall woman 

“well  not exactly ” said jane  “i was directed here by dr  dimble who
knows miss ironwood  he said i shouldnt need an appointment ”

“oh  if youre from dr  dimble that is another matter ” said the woman 
“come in  now wait a moment while i attend to this lock  thats better 
now were all right  theres not room for two on this path so you must
excuse me if i go first ”

the woman led her along a brick path beside a wall on which fruit trees
were growing  and then to the left along a mossy path with gooseberry
bushes on each side  then came a little lawn with a see-saw in the
middle of it  and beyond that a greenhouse  here they found themselves
in the sort of hamlet that sometimes occurs in the purlieus of a large
garden—walking in fact down a little street which had a barn and a
stable on one side and  on the other  a second greenhouse  and a potting
shed and a pigstye—inhabited  as the grunts and the not wholly
disagreeable smell informed her  after that were narrow paths across a
vegetable garden that seemed to be on a fairly steep hillside and then
rose bushes  all stiff and prickly in their winter garb  at one place
they were going along a path made of single planks  this reminded jane
of something  it was a very large garden  it was like       like      
yes  now she had it  it was like the garden in  peter rabbit   or was it
like the garden in the  romance of the rose   no  not in the least like
really  or like klingsors garden  or the garden in  alice   or like the
garden on the top of some mesopotamian ziggurat which had probably given
rise to the whole legend of paradise  or simply like all walled gardens 
freud said we liked gardens because they were symbols of the female
body  but that must be a mans point of view  presumably gardens meant
something different in womens dreams  or did they  did men and women
both feel interested in the female body and even  though it sounded
ridiculous  in almost the same way  a sentence rose to her memory  “the
beauty of the female is the root of joy to the female as well as to the
male  and it is no accident that the goddess of love is older and
stronger than the god ” where on earth had she read that  and 
incidentally  what frightful nonsense she had been thinking for the last
minute or so  she shook off all these ideas about gardens and determined
to pull herself together  a curious feeling that she was now on hostile 
or at least alien  ground warned her to keep all her wits about her  at
that moment they suddenly emerged from between plantations of
rhododendron and laurel and found themselves at a small side door 
flanked by a water butt  in the long wall of a large house  just as they
did so a window clapped shut upstairs 

a minute or two later jane was sitting waiting in a large sparely
furnished room with a shut stove to warm it  most of the floor was bare 
and the walls  above the waist-high wainscotting  were of greyish-white
plaster  so that the whole effect was faintly austere and conventual 
the tall womans tread died away in the passages and the room became
very quiet when it had done so  occasionally the cawing of rooks could
be heard  “ive let myself in for it now ” thought jane  “i shall have
to tell this woman that dream and shell ask all sorts of questions ”
she considered herself  in general  a modern person who could talk
without embarrassment of anything  but it began to look quite different
as she sat in that room  all sorts of secret reservations in her
programme of frankness—things which  she now realised  she had set apart
as never to be told—came creeping back into consciousness  it was
surprising that very few of them were connected with sex  “in dentists ”
said jane  “they at least leave illustrated papers in the waiting-room ”
she got up and opened the one book that lay on the table in the middle
of the room  instantly her eyes lit on the following words  “the beauty
of the female is the root of joy to the female as well as to the male 
and it is no accident that the goddess of love is older and stronger
than the god  to desire the desiring of her own beauty is the vanity of
lilith  but to desire the enjoying of her own beauty the obedience of
eve  and to both it is in the lover that the beloved tastes her own
delightfulness  as obedience is the stairway of pleasure  so humility is
the      ”

at that moment the door was suddenly opened  jane turned crimson as she
shut the book and looked up  the same girl who had first let her in had
apparently just opened the door and was still standing in the doorway 
jane now conceived for her that almost passionate admiration which
women  more often than is supposed  feel for other women whose beauty is
not of their own type  it would be nice  jane thought  to be like
that—so straight  so forthright  so valiant  so fit to be mounted on a
horse  and so divinely tall 

“is       is miss ironwood in ” said jane 

“are you mrs  studdock ” said the girl 

“yes ” said jane 

“i will bring you to her at once ” said the other  “we have been
expecting you  my name is camilla—camilla denniston ”

jane followed her  from the narrowness and plainness of the passages
jane judged that they were still in the back parts of the house  and
that  if so  it must be a very large house indeed  they went a long way
before camilla knocked at a door and stood aside for jane to enter 
after saying in a low  clear voice  “like a servant ” jane thought  
“she has come ” and jane went in  and there was miss ironwood dressed
all in black and sitting with her hands folded on her knees  just as
jane had seen her when dreaming—if she were dreaming—last night in the
flat 

“sit down  young lady ” said miss ironwood 

the hands which were folded on her knees were very big and boney though
they did not suggest coarseness  and even when seated miss ironwood was
extremely tall  everything about her was big—the nose  the unsmiling
lips  and the grey eyes  she was perhaps nearer sixty than fifty  there
was an atmosphere in the room which jane found uncongenial 

“what is your name  young lady ” said miss ironwood  taking up a pencil
and a note-book 

“jane studdock ”

“are you married ”

“yes ”

“does your husband know you have come to us ”

“no ”

“and your age  if you please ”

“twenty-three ”

“and now ” said miss ironwood  “what have you to tell me ”

jane took a deep breath  “ive been having bad dreams and—and feeling
depressed lately ” she said 

“what were the dreams ” asked miss ironwood 

janes narrative—she did not do it very well—took some time  while she
was speaking she kept her eyes fixed on miss ironwoods large hands and
her black skirt and the pencil and the note-book  and that was why she
suddenly stopped  for as she proceeded she saw miss ironwoods hand
cease to write and the fingers wrap themselves round the pencil 
immensely strong fingers they seemed  and every moment they tightened 
till the knuckles grew white and the veins stood out on the backs of the
hands  and at last  as if under the influence of some stifled emotion 
they broke the pencil in two  it was then that jane stopped in
astonishment and looked up at miss ironwoods face  the wide grey eyes
were still looking at her with no change of expression 

“pray continue  young lady ” said miss ironwood 

jane resumed her story  when she had finished  miss ironwood put a
number of questions  after that she became silent for so long that jane
said 

“is there  do you think  anything very serious wrong with me ”

“there is nothing wrong with you ” said miss ironwood 

“you mean it will go away ”

“i have no means of telling  i should say probably not ”

“then—cant anything be done about it  they were horrible
dreams—horribly vivid  not like dreams at all ”

“i can quite understand that ”

“is it something that cant be cured ”

“the reason you cannot be cured is that you are not ill ”

“but there must be something wrong  its surely not natural to have
dreams like that ”

there was a pause  “i think ” said miss ironwood  “i had better tell you
the whole truth ”

“yes  do ” said jane in a strained voice  the others words had
frightened her 

“and i will begin by saying this ” continued miss ironwood  “you are a
more important person than you imagine ”

jane said nothing  but thought inwardly  “she is humouring me  she
thinks i am mad ”

“what was your maiden name ” asked miss ironwood 

“tudor ” said jane  at any other moment she would have said it rather
self-consciously  for she was very anxious not to be supposed vain of
her ancient ancestry 

“the warwickshire branch of the family ”

“yes ”

“did you ever read a little book—it is only forty pages long—written by
an ancestor of yours about the battle of worcester ”

“no  father had a copy—the only copy  i think he said  but i never read
it  it was lost when the house was broken up after his death ”

“your father was mistaken in thinking it the only copy  there are at
least two others  one is in america  and the other is in this house ”

“well ”

“your ancestor gave a full and  on the whole  correct account of the
battle  which he says he completed on the same day on which it was
fought  but he was not at it  he was in york at the time ”

jane  who had not really been following this  looked at miss ironwood 

“if he was speaking the truth ” said miss ironwood  “and we believe that
he was  he dreamed it  do you understand ”

“dreamed about the battle ”

“yes  but dreamed it right  he saw the real battle in his dream ”

“i dont see the connection ”

“vision—the power of dreaming realities—is sometimes hereditary ” said
miss ironwood 

something seemed to be interfering with janes breathing  she felt a
sense of injury—this was just the sort of thing she hated  something out
of the past  something irrational and utterly uncalled for  coming up
from its den and interfering with her 

“can it be proved ” she asked  “i mean  we have only his word for it ”

“we have your dreams ” said miss ironwood  her voice  always grave  had
become stern  a fantastic thought crossed janes mind  could this old
woman have some idea that one ought not to call even ones remote
ancestors liars 

“my dreams ” she said a little sharply 

“yes ” said miss ironwood 

“what do you mean ”

“my opinion is that you have seen real things in your dreams  you have
seen alcasan as he really sat in the condemned cell  and you have seen a
visitor whom he really had ”

“but—but—oh  this is ridiculous ” said jane  “ that  part was a mere
coincidence  the rest was just nightmare  it was all impossible  he
screwed off his head  i tell you  and they       dug up the horrible old
man  they made him come to life ”

“there are some confusions there  no doubt  but in my opinion there are
realities behind even those episodes ”

“i am afraid i dont believe in that sort of thing ” said jane coldly 

“your upbringing makes it natural that you should not ” replied miss
ironwood  “unless  of course  you have discovered for yourself that you
have a tendency to dream real things ”

jane thought of the book on the table which she had apparently
remembered before she saw it  and then there was miss ironwoods own
appearance—that  too  she had seen before she saw it  but it must be
nonsense 

“can you  then  do nothing for me ”

“i can tell you the truth ” said miss ironwood  “i have tried to do so ”

“i mean  can you not stop it—cure it ”

“vision is not a disease ”

“but i dont  want  it ” said jane passionately  “i must stop it  i hate
this sort of thing ” miss ironwood said nothing 

“dont you even know of anyone who could stop it ” said jane  “cant you
recommend anyone ”

“if you go to an ordinary psychotherapist ” said miss ironwood  “he will
proceed on the assumption that the dreams merely reflect your own
subconscious  he would try to treat you  i do not know what would be the
results of treatment based on that assumption  i am afraid they might be
very serious  and—it would certainly not remove the dreams ”

“but what is this all about ” said jane  “i want to lead an ordinary
life  i want to do my own work  its unbearable  why should i be
selected for this horrible thing ”

“the answer to that is known only to authorities much higher than
myself ”

there was a short silence  jane made a vague movement and said  rather
sulkily  “well  if you can do nothing for me  perhaps id better be
going      ” then suddenly she added  “but how can you  know  all this 
i mean       what realities are you talking about ”

“i think ” said miss ironwood  “that you yourself have probably more
reason to suspect the truth of your dreams than you have yet told me  if
not  you soon will have  in the meantime i will answer your question  we
know your dreams to be partly true because they fit in with information
we already possess  it was because he saw their importance that dr 
dimble sent you to us ”

“do you mean he sent me here not to be cured but to give information ”
said jane  the idea fitted in with things she had observed in his manner
when she first told him 

“exactly ”

“i wish i had known that a little earlier ” said jane coldly  and now
definitely getting up to go  “im afraid it has been a misunderstanding 
i had imagined dr  dimble was trying to help me ”

“he was  but he was also trying to do something more important at the
same time ”

“i suppose i should be grateful for being considered at all ” said jane
dryly  “and how  exactly  was i to be helped by—by all this sort of
thing ” the attempt at icy irony collapsed as she said these last words
and red  undisguised anger rushed back into her face  in some ways she
was very young 

“young lady ” said miss ironwood  “you do not at all realise the
seriousness of this matter  the things you have seen concern something
compared with which the happiness  or even the life  of you and me  is 
of no importance  i must beg you to face the situation  you cannot get
rid of your gift  you can try to suppress it  but you will fail  and you
will be very badly frightened  on the other hand  you can put it at our
disposal  if you do so  you will be much less frightened in the long run
and you will be helping to save the human race from a very great
disaster  or thirdly  you may tell someone else about it  if you do
that  i warn you that you will almost certainly fall into the hands of
other people who are at least as anxious as we to make use of your
faculty and who will care no more about your life and happiness than
about those of a fly  the people you have seen in your dreams are real
people  it is not at all unlikely that they know you have 
involuntarily  been spying on them  and  if so  they will not rest till
they have got hold of you  i would advise you  even for your own sake 
to join our side ”

“you keep on talking of  we  and  us   are you some kind of company ”

“yes  you may call it a company ”

jane had been standing for the last few minutes  and she had almost been
believing what she heard  then suddenly all her repugnance came over her
again—all her wounded vanity  her resentment of the meaningless
complication in which she seemed to be caught  and her general dislike
of the mysterious and the unfamiliar  at that moment nothing seemed to
matter but to get out of that room and away from the grave  patient
voice of miss ironwood  “shes made me worse already ” thought jane 
still regarding herself as a patient  aloud  she said 

“i must go home now  i dont know what you are talking about  i dont
want to have anything to do with it ”


                                   iv

mark discovered in the end that he was expected to stay  at least for
the night  and when he went up to dress for dinner he was feeling more
cheerful  this was partly due to a whisky and soda taken with “fairy”
hardcastle immediately before  and partly to the fact that by a glance
at the mirror he saw that he could now remove the objectionable piece of
cotton wool from his lip  the bedroom with its bright fire and its
private bathroom attached had also something to do with it  thank
goodness he had allowed jane to talk him into buying that new
dress-suit  it looked very well  laid out on the bed  and he saw now
that the old one really would not have done  but what had reassured him
most of all was his conversation with the fairy 

it would be misleading to say that he liked her  she had indeed excited
in him all the distaste which a young man feels at the proximity of
something rankly  even insolently  sexed and at the same time wholly
unattractive  and something in her cold eye had told him that she was
well aware of this reaction and found it amusing  she had told him a
good many smoking-room stories  often before now mark had shuddered at
the clumsy efforts of the emancipated female to indulge in this kind of
humour  but his shudders had always been consoled by a sense of
superiority  this time he had the feeling that he was the butt  this
woman was exasperating male prudery for her diversion  later on she
drifted into police reminiscences  in spite of some initial scepticism 
mark was gradually horrified by her assumption that about thirty per
cent of our murder trials ended by the hanging of an innocent man  there
were details  too  about the execution shed which had not occurred to
him before 

all this was disagreeable  but it was made up for by the deliciously
esoteric character of the conversation  several times that day he had
been made to feel himself an outsider  that feeling completely
disappeared while miss hardcastle was talking to him  he had the sense
of getting  in   miss hardcastle had apparently lived an exciting life 
she had been  at different times  a suffragette  a pacifist  and a
british fascist  she had been manhandled by the police and imprisoned 
on the other hand  she had met prime ministers  dictators  and famous
film stars  all her history was secret history  she knew from both ends
what a police force could do and what it could not  and there were in
her opinion very few things it could not do  “specially now ” she said 
“here in the institute  were backing the crusade against red tape ”

mark gathered that  for the fairy  the police side of the institute was
the really important side  it existed to relieve the ordinary executive
of what might be called all sanitary cases—a category which ranged from
vaccination to charges of unnatural vice—from which  as she pointed out 
it was only a step to bringing in all cases of blackmail  as regards
crime in general  they had already popularised in the press the idea
that the institute should be allowed to experiment pretty largely in the
hope of discovering how far humane  remedial treatment could be
substituted for the old notion of “retributive” or “vindictive”
punishment  that was where a lot of legal red tape stood in their way 
“but there are only two papers we dont control ” said the fairy  “and
well smash them  youve got to get the ordinary man into the state in
which he says sadism automatically when he hears the word punishment ”
and then one would have  carte blanche   mark did not immediately follow
this  but the fairy pointed out that what had hampered every english
police force up to date was precisely the idea of deserved punishment 
for desert was always finite  you could do so much to the criminal and
no more  remedial treatment  on the other hand  need have no fixed
limit  it could go on till it had effected a cure  and those who were
carrying it out would decide when  that  was  and if cure were humane
and desirable  how much more prevention  soon anyone who had ever been
in the hands of the police at all would come under the control of the
n i c e   in the end  every citizen  “and thats where you and i come
in  sonny ” added the fairy  tapping marks chest with her forefinger 
“theres no distinction in the long run between police work and
sociology  you and ive got to work hand in hand ”

this had brought mark back to his doubts as to whether he were really
being given a job and  if so  what it was  the fairy had warned him that
steele was a dangerous man  “there are two people you want to be very
cautious about ” she said  “one is frost and the other is old wither ”
but she had laughed at his fears in general  “youre in all right 
sonny ” she said  “only dont be too particular about what exactly
youve got to do  youll find out as it comes along  wither doesnt like
people who try to pin him down  theres no good saying youve come here
to do  this  and you wont do  that   the games too fast just at
present for that sort of thing  youve got to make yourself useful  and
dont believe everything youre told ”

at dinner mark found himself seated next to hingest 

“well ” said hingest  “have they finally roped you into it  eh ”

“i rather believe they have ” said mark 

“because ” said hingest  “if you thought the better of it im motoring
back to-night and i could give you a lift ”

“you havent yet told me why you are leaving us yourself ” said mark 

“oh  well  it all depends what a man likes  if you enjoy the society of
that italian eunuch and the mad parson and that hardcastle girl—her
grandmother would have boxed her ears if she were alive—of course
theres nothing more to be said ”

“i suppose its hardly to be judged on purely social grounds—i mean 
its something more than a club ”

“eh  judged  never judged anything in my life  to the best of my
knowledge  except at a flower show  its all a question of taste  i came
here because i thought it had something to do with science  now that i
find its something more like a political conspiracy  i shall go home 
im too old for that kind of thing  and if i wanted to join a
conspiracy  this one wouldnt be my choice ”

“you mean  i suppose  that the element of social planning doesnt appeal
to you  i can quite understand that it doesnt fit in with your work as
it does with sciences like sociology  but——”

“there  are  no sciences like sociology  and if i found chemistry
beginning to fit in with a secret police run by a middle-aged virago who
doesnt wear corsets and a scheme for taking away his farm and his shop
and his children from every englishman  id let chemistry go to the
devil and take up gardening again ”

“i think i  do  understand that sentiment that still attaches to the
small man  but when you come to study the reality as i have had to do——”

“i should want to pull it to bits and put something else in its place 
of course  thats what happens when you study men  you find mares
nests  i happen to believe that you cant study men  you can only get to
know them  which is quite a different thing  because you study them  you
want to make the lower orders govern the country and listen to classical
music  which is balderdash  you also want to take away from them
everything which makes life worth living  and not only from them but
from everyone except a parcel of prigs and professors ”

“bill ” said fairy hardcastle suddenly  from the far side of the table 
in a voice so loud that even he could not ignore it  hingest fixed his
eyes upon her and his face grew a dark red 

“is it true ” bawled the fairy  “that youre going off by car
immediately after dinner ”

“yes  miss hardcastle  it is ”

“i was wondering if you could give me a lift ”

“i should be happy to do so ” said hingest in a voice not intended to
deceive  “if we are going in the same direction ”

“where are you going ”

“i am going to edgestow ”

“will you be passing brenstock ”

“no  i leave the by-pass at the cross-roads just beyond lord holywoods
front gate and go down what they used to call potters lane ”

“oh  damn  no good to me  i may as well wait till the morning ”

after this mark found himself engaged by his left-hand neighbour and did
not see bill the blizzard again until he met him in the hall after
dinner  he was in his overcoat and just ready to step into his car 

he began talking as he opened the door and thus mark was drawn into
accompanying him across the gravel sweep to where his car was parked 

“take my advice  studdock ” he said  “or at least think it over  i dont
believe in sociology myself  but youve got quite a decent career before
you if you stay at bracton  youll do yourself no good by getting mixed
up with the n i c e —and  by god  youll do nobody else any good
either ”

“i suppose there are two views about everything ” said mark 

“eh  two views  there are a dozen views about everything until you know
the answer  then theres never more than one  but its no affair of
mine  good night ”

“good night  hingest ” said mark  the other started up the car and drove
off 

there was a touch of frost in the air  the shoulder of orion  though
mark did not know even that earnest constellation  flamed at him above
the treetops  he felt a hesitation about going back into the house  it
might mean further talk with interesting and influential people  but it
might also mean feeling once more an outsider  hanging about and
watching conversations which he could not join  anyway  he was tired 
strolling along the front of the house he came presently to another and
smaller door by which  he judged  one could enter without passing
through the hall or the public rooms  he did so  and went upstairs for
the night immediately 


                                   v

camilla denniston showed jane out—not by the little door in the wall at
which she had come in  but by the main gate which opened on the same
road about a hundred yards farther on  yellow light from a westward gap
in the grey sky was pouring a short-lived and chilly brightness over the
whole landscape  jane had been ashamed to show either temper or anxiety
before camilla  as a result both had in reality been diminished when she
said good-bye  but a settled distaste for what she called “all this
nonsense” remained  she was not indeed sure that it was nonsense  but
she had already resolved to treat it as if it were  she would not get
“mixed up in it ” would not be drawn in  one had to live ones own life 
to avoid entanglements and interferences had long been one of her first
principles  even when she had discovered that she was going to marry
mark if he asked her  the thought “but i must still keep up my own life”
had arisen at once and had never for more than a few minutes at a
stretch been absent from her mind  some resentment against love itself 
and therefore against mark  for thus invading her life  remained  she
was at least very vividly aware how much a woman gives up in getting
married  mark seemed to her insufficiently aware of this  though she did
not formulate it  this fear of being invaded and entangled was the
deepest ground of her determination not to have a child—or not for a
long time yet  one had ones own life to live 

almost as soon as she got back to the flat the telephone went  “is that
you  jane ” came a voice  “its me  margaret dimble  such a dreadful
things happened  ill tell you when i come  im too angry to speak at
the moment  have you a spare bed by any chance  what  mr  studdocks
away  not a bit  if  you  dont mind  ive sent cecil to sleep in
college  youre sure it wont be a nuisance  thanks most awfully  ill
be round in half an hour ”




                                  four
                    the liquidation of anachronisms 


                                   i

almost before jane had finished putting clean sheets on marks bed  mrs 
dimble  with a great many parcels  arrived  “youre an angel to have me
for the night ” she said  “wed tried every hotel in edgestow i believe 
this place is going to become unendurable  the same answer everywhere 
all full up with the hangers-on and camp followers of this detestable
n i c e  secretaries here—typists there—commissioners of works—the
things outrageous  if cecil hadnt had a room in college i really
believe hed have had to sleep in the waiting-room at the station  i
only hope that man in college has aired the bed ”

“but what on earths happened ” asked jane 

“turned out  my dear ”

“but it isnt possible  mrs  dimble  i mean  it cant be legal ”

“thats what cecil said        just think of it  jane  the first thing
we saw when we poked our heads out of the window this morning was a
lorry on the drive with its back wheels in the middle of the rose bed 
unloading a small army of what looked like criminals with picks and
spades  right in our own garden  there was an odious little man in a
peaked cap who talked to cecil with a cigarette in his mouth  at least
it wasnt in his mouth but seccotined onto his upper lip—you know—and
guess what he said  he said theyd have no objection to our remaining in
possession  of the  house   mind you  not the garden  till eight oclock
to-morrow morning  no objection ”

“but surely—surely—it must be some mistake ”

“of course cecil rang up your bursar  and of course your bursar was out 
that took nearly all morning  ringing up again and again  and by that
time the big beech that you used to be so fond of had been cut down  and
all the plum trees  if i hadnt been so angry id have sat down and
cried my eyes out  thats what i felt like  at last cecil did get on to
your mr  busby  who was perfectly useless  said there must be some
misunderstanding  but it was out of his hands now and wed better get on
to the n i c e  at belbury  of course it turned out to be quite
impossible to get  them   but by lunch-time we saw that one simply
 couldnt  stay there for the night  whatever happened ”

“why not ”

“my dear  youve no conception what it was like  great lorries and
traction engines roaring past all the time  and a crane on a thing like
a railway truck  why  our own tradesmen couldnt get through it  the
milk didnt arrive till eleven oclock  the meat never arrived at all 
they rang up in the afternoon to say their people hadnt been able to
reach us by either road  wed the greatest difficulty in getting into
town ourselves  it took us half an hour from our house to the bridge  it
was like a nightmare  flares and noise everywhere and the road
practically ruined and a sort of great tin camp already going up on the
common  and the people  such horrid men  i didnt know we  had 
workpeople like that in england  oh  horrible  horrible ” mrs  dimble
fanned herself with the hat she had just taken off 

“and what are you going to do ” asked jane 

“heaven knows ” said mrs  dimble  “for the moment we have shut up the
house and cecil has been at rumbold the solicitors  to see if we can at
least have it sealed and left alone until weve got our things out of
it  rumbold doesnt seem to know where he is  he keeps on saying the
n i c e  are in a very peculiar position legally  after that  im sure i
dont know  as far as i can see there wont  be  any houses in edgestow 
theres no question of trying to live on the far side of the river any
longer  even if theyd let us  what did you say  oh  indescribable  all
the poplars are going down  all those nice little cottages by the church
are going down  i found poor ivy—thats your mrs  maggs  you know—in
tears  poor things  they do look dreadful when they cry on top of
powder  shes being turned out too  poor little woman  shes had enough
troubles in her life without this  i was glad to get away  the men were
so horrible  three big brutes came to the back door asking for hot water
and went on so that they frightened martha out of her wits and cecil had
to go and speak to them  i thought they were going to strike cecil 
really i did  it was most horribly unpleasant  but a sort of special
constable sent them away  what  oh yes  there are dozens of what look
like policemen all over the place  and i didnt like the look of  them 
either  swinging some kind of truncheon things  like what youd see in
an american film  do you know  jane  cecil and i both thought the same
thing  we thought  its almost as if wed lost the war  oh  good girl 
tea  thats just what i wanted ”

“you must stay here as long as you like  mrs  dimble ” said jane 
“markll just have to sleep in college ”

“well  really ” said mother dimble  “i feel at the moment that no fellow
of bracton ought to be allowed to sleep anywhere  but id make an
exception in favour of mr  studdock  as a matter of fact  i shant have
to behave like the sword of siegfried—and  incidentally  a nasty fat
stodgy sword i should be  but that side of it is all fixed up  cecil and
i are to go out to the manor at st  annes  we have to be there so much
at present  you see ”

“oh ” said jane  involuntarily prolonging the exclamation as the whole
of her own story flowed back on her mind 

“why  what a selfish pig ive been ” said mother dimble  “here have i
been chattering away about my own troubles and quite forgetting that
youve been out there and are full of things to tell me  did you see
grace  and did you like her ”

“is grace miss ironwood ” asked jane 

“yes ”

“i saw her  i dont know if i liked her or not  but i dont want to talk
about all that  i cant think about anything except this outrageous
business of yours  its you who are the real martyr  not me ”

“no  my dear ” said mrs  dimble  “im not a martyr  im only an angry
old woman with sore feet and a splitting head  but thats beginning to
be better  whos trying to talk herself into a good temper  after all 
cecil and i havent lost our livelihood as poor ivy maggs has  it
doesnt  really  matter leaving the old house  do you know  the pleasure
of living there was in a way a melancholy pleasure   i wonder  by the
bye  do human beings really  like  being happy   a little melancholy 
yes  all those big upper rooms which we thought we should want because
we thought we were going to have lots of children  and then we never
had  perhaps i was getting too fond of mooning about them on long
afternoons when cecil was away  pitying oneself  i shall be better away
from it  i dare say  i might have got like that frightful woman in ibsen
who was always maundering about dolls  its really worse for cecil  he
did so love having all his pupils about the place  jane  thats the
third time youve yawned  youre dropping asleep and ive talked your
head off  it comes of being married for thirty years  husbands were made
to be talked to  it helps them to concentrate their minds on what
theyre reading—like the sound of a weir  there —youre yawning again ”

jane found mother dimble an embarrassing person to share a room with
because she said prayers  it was quite extraordinary  jane thought  how
this put one out  one didnt know where to look  and it was so difficult
to talk naturally again for several minutes after mrs  dimble had risen
from her knees 


                                   ii

“are you awake now ” said mrs  dimbles voice  quietly  in the middle of
the night 

“yes ” said jane  “im so sorry  did i wake you up  was i shouting ”

“yes  you were shouting out about someone being hit on the head ”

“i saw them killing a man       a man in a big car driving along a
country road  then he came to a cross-roads and turned off to the right
past some trees  and there was someone standing in the middle of the
road waving a light to stop him  i couldnt hear what they said  i was
too far away  they must have persuaded him to get out of the car
somehow  and there he was talking to one of them  the light fell full on
his face  he wasnt the same old man i saw in my other dream  he hadnt
a beard  only a moustache  and he had a very quick  kind of proud  way 
he didnt like what the man said to him and presently he put up his
fists and knocked him down  another man behind him tried to hit him on
the head with something  but the old man was too quick and turned round
in time  then it was rather horrible  but rather fine  there were three
of them at him and he was fighting them all  ive read about that kind
of thing in books  but i never realised how one would feel about it  of
course they got him in the end  they beat his head about terribly with
the things in their hands  they were quite cool about it and stooped
down to examine him and make sure he was really dead  the light from the
lantern seemed all funny  it looked as if it made long uprights of
light—sort of rods—all round the place  but perhaps i was waking up by
then  no thanks  im all right  it was horrid  of course  but im not
really frightened       not the way i would have been before  im more
sorry for the old man ”

“you feel you can go to sleep again ”

“oh rather  is your headache better  mrs  dimble ”

“quite gone  thank you  good night ”


                                  iii

“without a doubt ” thought mark  “this must be the mad parson that bill
the blizzard was talking of ” the committee at belbury did not meet till
10 30  and ever since breakfast he had been walking with the reverend
straik in the garden  despite the raw and misty weather of the morning 
at the very moment when the man had first buttonholed him  the
threadbare clothes and clumsy boots  the frayed clerical collar  the
dark  lean  tragic face  gashed and ill-shaved and seamed  and the
bitter sincerity of his manner  had struck a discordant note  it was not
a type mark had expected to meet in the n i c e 

“do not imagine ” said mr  straik  “that i indulge in any dreams of
carrying out our programme without violence  there will be resistance 
they will gnaw their tongues and not repent  we are not to be deterred 
we face these disorders with a firmness which will lead traducers to say
that we have desired them  let them say so  in a sense we have  it is no
part of our witness to preserve that organisation of ordered sin which
is called society  to that organisation the message which we have to
deliver is a message of absolute despair ”

“now that is what i meant ” said mark  “when i said that your point of
view and mine must  in the long run  be incompatible  the preservation 
which involves the thorough planning  of society is just precisely the
end i have in view  i do not think there is or can be any other end  the
problem is quite different for you because you look forward to something
else  something better than human society  in some other world ”

“with every thought and vibration of my heart  with every drop of my
blood ” said mr  straik  “i repudiate that damnable doctrine  that is
precisely the subterfuge by which the world  the organisation and body
of death  has sidetracked and emasculated the teaching of jesus  and
turned into priestcraft and mysticism the plain demand of the lord for
righteousness and judgement here and now  the kingdom of god is to be
realised here—in this world  and it will be  at the name of jesus every
knee shall bow  in that name i dissociate myself completely from all the
organised religion that has yet been seen in the world ”

and at the name of jesus  mark  who would have lectured on abortion or
perversion to an audience of young women without a qualm  felt himself
so embarrassed that he knew his cheeks were slightly reddening  and he
became so angry with himself and mr  straik at this discovery that they
then proceeded to redden very much indeed  this was exactly the kind of
conversation he could not endure  and never since the well-remembered
misery of scripture lessons at school had he felt so uncomfortable  he
muttered something about his ignorance of theology 

“theology ” said mr  straik with profound contempt  “its not theology
im talking about  young man  but the lord jesus  theology is
talk—eyewash—a smoke screen—a game for rich men  it wasnt in lecture
rooms i found the lord jesus  it was in the coal pits  and beside the
coffin of my daughter  if they think that theology is a sort of cotton
wool which will keep them safe in the great and terrible day  theyll
find their mistake  for  mark my words  this thing is going to happen 
the kingdom is going to arrive  in this world  in this country  the
powers of science are an instrument  an irresistible instrument  as all
of us in the n i c e  know  and why are they an irresistible
instrument ”

“because science is based on observation ” suggested mark 

“they are an irresistible instrument ” shouted straik  “because they are
an instrument in his hand  an instrument of judgement as well as of
healing  that is what i couldnt get any of the churches to see  they
are blinded  blinded by their filthy rags of humanism  their culture and
humanitarianism and liberalism  as well as by their sins  or what they
think their sins  though they are really the least sinful thing about
them  that is why i have come to stand alone  a poor  weak  unworthy old
man  but the only prophet left  i knew that he was coming in power  and
therefore  where we see power  we see the sign of his coming  and that
is why i find myself joining with profligates and materialists and
anyone else who is really ready to expedite the coming  the feeblest of
these people here has the tragic sense of life  the ruthlessness  the
total commitment  the readiness to sacrifice all merely human values 
which i could not find amid all the nauseating cant of the organised
religions ”

“you mean  do you ” said mark  “that as far as immediate practice is
concerned  there are no limits to your co-operation with the programme ”

“sweep away all idea of co-operation ” said the other  “does clay
 co-operate  with the potter  did cyrus  co-operate  with the lord 
these people will be used  i shall be used too  instruments  vehicles 
but here comes the point that concerns you  young man  you have no
choice whether you will be used or not  there is no turning back once
you have set your hand to the plough  no one goes  out  of the n i c e 
those who try to turn back will perish in the wilderness  but the
question is whether you are content to be one of the instruments which
is thrown aside when it has served his turn—one which  having executed
judgement on others  is reserved for judgement itself—or will you be
among those who enter on the inheritance  for its all true  you know 
it is the saints who are going to inherit the earth—here in england 
perhaps within the next twelve months—the saints and no one else  know
you not that we shall judge angels ” then  suddenly lowering his voice 
straik added  “the  real  resurrection is even now taking place  the
real life everlasting  here in this world  you will see it ”

“i say ” said mark  “its nearly twenty past  oughtnt we to be going to
the committee ”

straik turned with him in silence  partly to avoid further conversation
along the same lines  and partly because he really wanted to know the
answer  mark said presently  “a rather annoying thing has happened  ive
lost my wallet  there wasnt much money in it  only about three pounds 
but there were letters and things  and its a nuisance  ought i to tell
someone about it ”

“you could tell the steward ” said straik 


                                   iv

the committee sat for about two hours and the deputy director was in the
chair  his method of conducting business was slow and involved  and to
mark  with his bracton experience to guide him  it soon became obvious
that the real work of the n i c e  must go on somewhere else  this 
indeed  was what he had expected  and he was too reasonable to suppose
that he should find himself  at this early stage  in the inner ring or
whatever at belbury corresponded to the progressive element at bracton 
but he hoped he would not be kept marking time on phantom committees for
too long  this morning the business mainly concerned the details of the
work which had already been begun at edgestow  the n i c e  had
apparently won some sort of victory which gave it the right to pull down
the little norman church at the corner  “the usual objections were  of
course  tabled ” said wither  mark who was not interested in
architecture and who did not know the other side of the wynd nearly so
well as his wife  allowed his attention to wander  it was only at the
end of the meeting that wither opened a much more sensational subject 
he believed that most of those present had already heard  “why do
chairmen always begin that way ” thought mark  the very distressing
piece of news which it was  nevertheless  his duty now to communicate to
them in a semi-official manner  he was referring  of course  to the
murder of mr  william hingest  as far as mark could discover from the
chairmans tortuous and allusive narrative  bill the blizzard had been
discovered with his head beaten in by some blunt instrument  lying near
his car in potters lane at about four oclock that morning  he had been
dead for several hours  mr  wither ventured to suppose that it would be
a melancholy pleasure to the committee to know that n i c e  police had
been on the scene of the crime before five  and that neither the local
authorities nor scotland yard were making any objections to the fullest
collaboration  he felt that if the occasion were more appropriate he
would have welcomed a motion for some expression of the gratitude they
must all feel to miss hardcastle and possibly of congratulations to her
on the smooth interaction between her own forces and those of the state 
this was a most gratifying feature in the sad story and  he suggested  a
good omen for the future  some decently subdued applause went round the
table at this  mr  wither then proceeded to speak at some length about
the dead man  they had all much regretted mr  hingests resolution to
withdraw from the n i c e   while fully appreciating his motives  they
had all felt that this official severance would not in the least alter
the cordial relations which existed between the deceased and almost
all—he thought he could even say all without exception—of his former
colleagues in the institute  the obituary  in raleighs fine phrase  was
an instrument which the deputy directors talents well fitted him to
play  and he spoke at great length  he concluded by suggesting that they
should all stand in silence for one minute as a token of respect for the
memory of william hingest 

and they did—a world-without-end minute in which odd creakings and
breathings became audible  and behind the mask of each glazed and
tight-lipped face  shy  irrelevant thoughts of this and that came
creeping out as birds and mice creep out again in the clearing of a wood
when the picnickers have gone  and everyone silently assured himself
that he  at least  was not being morbid and not thinking about death 

then there was a stir and a bustle and the committee broke up 


                                   v

the whole process of getting up and doing the “morning jobs” was more
cheerful  jane found  because she had mrs  dimble with her  mark often
helped  but as he always took the view—and jane could feel it even if he
did not express it in words—that “anything would do” and that jane made
a lot of unnecessary work and that men could keep house with a tithe of
the fuss and trouble which women made about it  marks help was one of
the commonest causes of quarrels between them  mrs  dimble  on the other
hand  fell in with her ways  it was a bright sunny morning  and as they
sat down to breakfast in the kitchen jane was feeling bright herself 
during the night her mind had evolved a comfortable theory that the mere
fact of having seen miss ironwood and “had it all out” would probably
stop the dreams altogether  the episode would be closed  and now—there
was all the exciting possibility of marks new job to look forward to 
she began to see pictures in her mind 

mrs  dimble was anxious to know what had happened to jane at st  annes
and when she was going there again  jane answered evasively on the first
question and mrs  dimble was too polite to press it  as to the second 
jane thought she wouldnt “bother” miss ironwood again  or wouldnt
“bother” any further about the dreams  she said she had been “silly” but
felt sure shed be all right now  and she glanced at the clock and
wondered why mrs  maggs hadnt yet turned up 

“my dear  im afraid youve lost ivy maggs ” said mrs  dimble  “didnt i
tell you theyd taken her house too  i thought youd understand she
wouldnt be coming to you in future  you see theres nowhere for her to
live in edgestow ”

“bother ” said jane  and added  without much interest in the reply 
“what is she doing  do you know ”

“shes gone out to st  annes ”

“has she got friends there ”

“shes gone to the manor  along with cecil and me ”

“do you mean shes got a job there ”

“well  yes  i suppose it is a job ”

mrs  dimble left at about eleven  she also  it appeared  was going to
st  annes  but was first to meet her husband and lunch with him at
northumberland  jane walked down to the town with her to do a little
shopping and they parted at the bottom of market street  it was just
after this that jane met mr  curry 

“have you heard the news  mrs  studdock ” said curry  his manner was
always important and his tone always vaguely confidential  but this
morning they seemed more so than usual 

“no  whats wrong ” said jane  she thought mr  curry a pompous fool and
mark a fool for being impressed by him  but as soon as curry began
speaking her face showed all the wonder and consternation he could have
wished  nor were they  this time  feigned  he told her that mr  hingest
had been murdered  some time during the night or in the small hours of
that morning  the body had been found lying beside his car  in potters
lane  badly beaten about the head  he had been driving from belbury to
edgestow  curry was at the moment hastening back to college to talk to
the warden about it  he had just been at the police station  one saw
that the murder had already become currys property  the “matter” was 
in some indefinable sense  “in his hands ” and he was heavy with
responsibility  at another time jane would have found this amusing  she
escaped from him as soon as possible and went into blackies for a cup
of coffee  she felt she must sit down 

the death of hingest in itself meant nothing to her  she had met him
only once and she had accepted from mark the view that he was a
disagreeable old man and rather a snob  but the certainty that she
herself in her dream had witnessed a real murder shattered at one blow
all the consoling pretences with which she had begun the morning  it
came over her with sickening clarity that the affair of her dreams  far
from being ended  was only beginning  the bright  narrow little life
which she had proposed to live was being irremediably broken into 
windows into huge  dark landscapes were opening on every side and she
was powerless to shut them  it would drive her mad  she thought  to face
it alone  the other alternative was to go back to miss ironwood  but
that seemed to be only a way of going deeper into all this darkness 
this manor at st  annes—this “kind of company”—was “mixed up in it ”
she didnt want to get drawn in  it was unfair  it wasnt as if she had
asked much of life  all she wanted was to be left alone  and the thing
was so preposterous  the sort of thing which  according to all the
authorities she had hitherto accepted  could not really happen 


                                   vi

cosser—the freckle-faced man with the little wisp of black
moustache—approached mark as he was coming away from the committee 

“you and i have a job to do ” he said  “got to get out a report about
cure hardy ”

mark was very relieved to hear of a job  but he was a little on his
dignity  not having liked cosser much when he had met him yesterday  and
he answered 

“does that mean i  am  to be in steeles department after all ”

“thats right ” said cosser 

“the reason i ask ” said mark  “is that neither he nor you seemed
particularly keen on having me  i dont want to push myself in  you
know  i dont need to stay at the n i c e  at all if it comes to that ”

“well  dont start talking about it here ” said cosser  “come upstairs ”

they were talking in the hall and mark noticed wither pacing
thoughtfully towards them  “wouldnt it be as well to speak to  him  and
get the whole thing thrashed out ” he suggested  but the deputy
director  after coming within ten feet of them  had turned in another
direction  he was humming to himself under his breath and seemed so deep
in thought that mark felt the moment unsuitable for an interview 
cosser  though he said nothing  apparently thought the same  and so mark
followed him up to an office on the third floor 

“its about the village of cure hardy ” said cosser  when they were
seated  “you see  all that land at bragdon wood is going to be little
better than a swamp once they get to work  why the hell we wanted to go
there i dont know  anyway  the latest plan is to divert the wynd  block
up the old channel through edgestow altogether  look  heres
shillingbridge  ten miles north of the town  its to be diverted there
and brought down an artificial channel—here  to the east  where the blue
line is—and rejoin the old bed down here ”

“the university will hardly agree to that ” said mark  “what would
edgestow be without the river ”

“weve got the university by the short hairs ” said cosser  “you neednt
worry about that  anyway its not our job  the point is that the new
wynd must come right through cure hardy  now look at your contours  cure
hardy is in this narrow little valley  eh  oh  youve been there  have
you  that makes it all the easier  i dont know these parts myself 
well  the idea is to dam the valley at the southern end and make a big
reservoir  youll need a new water supply for edgestow now that its to
be the second city in the country ”

“but what happens to cure hardy ”

“thats another advantage  we build a new model village  its to be
called jules hardy or wither hardy  four miles away  over here  on the
railway ”

“i say  you know  therell be the devil of a stink about this  cure
hardy is famous  its a beauty spot  there are the sixteenth-century
almshouses  and a norman church  and all that ”

“exactly  thats where you and i come in  weve got to make a report on
cure hardy  well run out and have a look round to-morrow  but we can
write most of the report to-day  it ought to be pretty easy  if its a
beauty spot  you can bet its insanitary  thats the first point to
stress  then weve got to get out some facts about the population  i
think youll find it consists almost entirely of the two most
undesirable elements—small  rentiers  and agricultural labourers ”

“the small  rentier  is a bad element  i agree ” said mark  “i suppose
the agricultural labourer is more controversial ”

“the institute doesnt approve of him  hes a very recalcitrant element
in a planned community  and hes always backward  were not going in for
english agriculture  so  you see  all we have to do is to verify a few
facts  otherwise the report writes itself ”

mark was silent for a moment or two 

“thats easy enough ” he said  “but before i get down to it id just
like to be a bit clearer about my own position  oughtnt i to go and see
steele  i dont fancy settling down to work in this department if he
doesnt want to have me ”

“i wouldnt do that ” said cosser 

“why not ”

“well  for one thing  steele cant prevent you if the d d  backs you up 
as he seems to be doing for the moment  for another  steele is rather a
dangerous man  if you just go quietly on with the job  he may get used
to you in the end  but if you go and see him it might lead to a bust up 
theres another thing  too ” cosser paused  picked his nose
thoughtfully  and proceeded  “between ourselves  i dont think things
can go on indefinitely in this department in the way they are at
present ”

the excellent training which mark had had at bracton enabled him to
understand this  cosser was hoping to get steele out of the department
altogether  he thought he saw the whole situation  steele was dangerous
while he lasted  but he might not last 

“i got the impression yesterday ” said mark  “that you and steele hit it
off together rather well ”

“the great thing here ” said cosser  “is never to quarrel with anyone  i
hate quarrels myself  i can get on with anybody—as long as the work gets
done ”

“of course ” said mark  “by the way  if we go to cure hardy to-morrow i
might as well run in to edgestow and spend the night at home ”

for mark a good deal hung on the answer to this  he might find out
whether he were actually under orders from cosser  if cosser said “you
cant do that” he would at least know where he stood  if cosser said
that mark couldnt be spared  that would be better still  or cosser
might reply that hed better consult the d d  that also would have made
mark feel surer of his position  but cosser merely said “oh ” leaving
mark in doubt whether no one needed leave of absence or whether mark was
not sufficiently established as a member of the institute for his
absence to be of any consequence  then they went to work on their
report 

it took them the rest of the day  so that cosser and he came in to
dinner late and without dressing  this gave mark a most agreeable
sensation  and he enjoyed the meal  too  although he was among men he
had not met before  he seemed to know everyone within the first five
minutes and to be joining naturally in the conversation  he was learning
how to talk their shop 

“how lovely it is ” said mark to himself next morning as the car left
the main road at dukes eaton and began descending the bumpy little lane
into the long valley where cure hardy lay  mark was not as a rule very
sensitive to beauty  but jane  and his love for jane  had already
awakened him a little in this respect  perhaps the winter morning
sunlight affected him all the more because he had never been taught to
regard it as specially beautiful and it therefore worked on his senses
without interference  the earth and sky had the look of things recently
washed  the brown fields looked as if they would be good to eat  and
those in grass set off the curves of the little hills as close-clipped
hair sets off the body of a horse  the sky looked farther away than
usual  but also clearer  so that the long  slender streaks of cloud
 dark slate colour against the pale blue  had edges as clear as if they
were cut out of cardboard  every little copse was black and bristling as
a hairbrush  and when the car stopped in cure hardy itself the silence
that followed the turning-off of the engine was filled with the noise of
rooks that seemed to be calling “wake  wake ”

“bloody awful noise those birds make ” said cosser  “got your map  now
     ” he plunged at once into business 

they walked about that village for two hours and saw with their own eyes
all the abuses and anachronisms they came to destroy  they saw the
recalcitrant and backward labourer and heard his views on the weather 
they met the wastefully supported pauper in the person of an old man
shuffling across the courtyard of the alms-houses to fill a kettle  and
the elderly  rentier   to make matters worse she had a fat old dog with
her  in earnest conversation with the postman  it made mark feel as if
he were on a holiday  for it was only on holidays that he had ever
wandered about an english village  for that reason he felt pleasure in
it  it did not quite escape him that the face of the backward labourer
was rather more interesting than cossers and his voice a great deal
more pleasing to the ear  the resemblance between the elderly  rentier 
and aunt gilly  when had he last thought of  her   good lord  that took
one back        did make him understand how it was possible to like that
kind of person  all this did not in the least influence his sociological
convictions  even if he had been free from belbury and wholly
unambitious  it could not have done so  for his education had had the
curious effect of making things that he read and wrote more real to him
than things he saw  statistics about agricultural labourers were the
substance  any real ditcher  ploughman  or farmers boy  was the shadow 
though he had never noticed it himself  he had a great reluctance  in
his work  ever to use such words as “man” or “woman ” he preferred to
write about “vocational group ” “elements ” “classes ” and
“populations”  for  in his own way  he believed as firmly as any mystic
in the superior reality of the things that are not seen 

and yet he could not help rather liking this village  when  at one
oclock  he persuaded cosser to turn into the two bells  he even said
so  they had both brought sandwiches with them  but mark felt he would
like a pint of beer  in the two bells it was very warm and dark  for the
window was small  two labourers  no doubt recalcitrant and backward 
were sitting with earthenware mugs at their elbows  munching very thick
sandwiches  and a third was standing up at the counter conducting a
conversation with the landlord 

“no beer for me  thanks ” said cosser  “and we dont want to muck about
here too long  what were you saying ”

“i was saying that on a fine morning there is something rather
attractive about a place like this  in spite of all its obvious
absurdities ”

“yes  it  is  a fine morning  makes a real difference to ones health  a
bit of sunlight ”

“i was thinking of the place ”

“you mean  this  ” said cosser  glancing round the room  “i should have
thought it was just the sort of thing we wanted to get rid of  no
sunlight  no ventilation  havent much use for alcohol myself  read the
miller report   but if people have got to have their stimulants  id
like to see them administered in a more hygienic way ”

“i dont know that the stimulant is quite the whole point ” said mark 
looking at his beer  the whole scene was reminding him of drinks and
talks long ago—of laughter and arguments in undergraduate days  somehow
one had made friends more easily then  he wondered what had become of
all that set—of carey and wadsden and denniston  who had so nearly got
his own fellowship 

“dont know  im sure ” said cosser  in answer to his last remark 
“nutrition isnt my subject  youd want to ask stock about that ”

“what im really thinking about ” said mark  “is not this pub  but the
whole village  of course youre quite right  that sort of thing has got
to go  but it had its pleasant side  well have to be careful that
whatever were building up in its place will really be able to beat it
on all levels—not merely in efficiency ”

“oh  architecture and all that ” said cosser  “well  thats hardly my
line  you know  thats more for someone like wither  have you nearly
finished ”

all at once it came over mark what a terrible bore this little man was 
and in the same moment he felt utterly sick of the n i c e  but he
reminded himself that one could not expect to be in the interesting set
at once  there would be better things later on  anyway  he had not burnt
his boats  perhaps he would chuck up the whole thing and go back to
bracton in a day or two  but not at once  it would be only sensible to
hang on for a bit and see how things shaped 

on their way back cosser dropped him near edgestow station  and as he
walked home mark began to think of what he would say to jane about
belbury  you will quite misunderstand him if you think he was
consciously inventing a lie  almost involuntarily  as the picture of
himself entering the flat  and of janes questioning face  arose in his
mind  there arose also the imagination of his own voice answering her 
hitting off the salient features of belbury in amusing  confident
phrases  this imaginary speech of his own gradually drove out of his
mind the real experiences he had undergone  those real experiences of
misgiving and of uneasiness  indeed  quickened his desire to cut a good
figure in the eyes of his wife  almost without noticing it  he had
decided not to mention the affair of cure hardy  jane cared for old
buildings and all that sort of thing  as a result  when jane  who was at
that moment drawing the curtains  heard the door opening and looked
round and saw mark  she saw a rather breezy and buoyant mark  yes  he
was almost sure hed got the job  the salary wasnt absolutely fixed 
but hed be going into that to-morrow  it was a very funny place  hed
explain all that later  but he had already got on to the real people
there  wither and miss hardcastle were the ones that mattered  “i  must 
tell you about the hardcastle woman ” he said  “shes quite incredible ”

jane had to decide what she would say to mark much more quickly than he
had decided what he would say to her  and she decided to tell him
nothing about the dreams or st  annes  men hated women who had things
wrong with them  specially queer  unusual things  her resolution was
easily kept  for mark  full of his own story  asked her no questions 
she was not  perhaps  entirely convinced by what he said  there was a
vagueness about all the details  very early in the conversation she said
in a sharp  frightened voice  she had no idea how he disliked that
voice   “mark  you havent given up your fellowship at bracton ” he said
no  of course not  and went on  she listened only with half her mind 
she knew he often had rather grandiose ideas  and from something in his
face she divined that during his absence he had been drinking much more
than he usually did  and so  all evening  the male bird displayed his
plumage and the female played her part and asked questions and laughed
and feigned more interest than she felt  both were young  and if neither
loved very much each was still anxious to be admired 


                                  vii

that evening the fellows of bracton sat in common room over their wine
and dessert  they had given up dressing for dinner  as an economy during
the war and not yet resumed the practice  so that their sports coats and
cardigans struck a somewhat discordant note against the dark jacobean
panels  the candle-light  and the silver of many different periods 
feverstone and curry were sitting together  until that night for about
three hundred years this common room had been one of the pleasant quiet
places of england  it was in lady alice  on the ground floor beneath the
soler  and the windows at its eastern end looked out on the river and on
bragdon wood  across a little terrace where the fellows were in the
habit of taking their dessert on summer evenings  at this hour and
season these windows were of course shut and curtained  and from beyond
them came such noises as had never been heard in that room before—shouts
and curses and the sound of lorries heavily drumming past or harshly
changing gear  rattling of chains  drumming of mechanical drills 
clanging of iron  whistles  thuddings  and an all-pervasive vibration 
 saeva sonare verbera  tum stridor ferri tractaeque catenae   as
glossop  sitting on the far side of the fire  had observed to jewel  for
beyond those windows  scarcely thirty yards away on the other side of
the wynd  the conversion of an ancient woodland into an inferno of mud
and noise and steel and concrete was already going on apace  several
members even of the progressive element—those who had rooms on this side
of college—had already been grumbling about it  curry himself had been a
little surprised by the form which his dream had taken now that it was a
reality  but he was doing his best to brazen it out  and though his
conversation with feverstone had to be conducted at the top of their
voices  he made no allusion to this inconvenience 

“its quite definite  then ” he bawled  “that young studdock is not
coming back ”

“oh  quite ” shouted feverstone  “he sent me a message through a high
official to tell me to let the college know ”

“when will he send a formal resignation ”

“havent an earthly  like all these youngsters hes very casual about
these things  as a matter of fact  the longer he delays the better ”

“you mean it gives us a chance to look about us ”

“quite  you see  nothing need come before the college till he writes 
one wants to have the whole question of his successor taped  before 
that ”

“obviously  that is most important  once you present an open question to
all these people who dont understand the field and dont know their own
minds you may get anything happening ”

“exactly  thats what we want to avoid  the only way to manage a place
like this is to produce your candidate—bring the rabbit out of the
hat—two minutes after youve announced the vacancy ”

“we must begin thinking about it at once ”

“does his successor have to be a sociologist  i mean is the fellowship
tied to the subject ”

“oh  not in the least  its one of those paston fellowships  why  had
you any subject in mind ”

“its a long time since we had anyone in politics ”

“um       yes  theres still a considerable prejudice against politics
as an academic subject  i say  feverstone  oughtnt we to give this new
subject a leg up ”

“what new subject ”

“pragmatometry ”

“well  now  its funny you should say that  because the man i was
beginning to think of is a politician who has also been going in a good
deal for pragmatometry  one could call it a fellowship in social
pragmatometry  or something like that ”

“who is the man ”

“laird—from leicester  cambridge ”

it was automatic for curry to look very thoughtful  though he had never
heard of laird  and to say “ah  laird  just remind me of the details of
his academic career ”

“well ” said feverstone  “as you remember  he was in bad health at the
time of his finals  and came rather a cropper  the cambridge examining
is so bad nowadays that one hardly counts that  everyone knew he was one
of the most brilliant men of his year  he was president of the sphinxes
and used to edit  the adult   david laird  you know ”

“yes  to be sure  david laird  but i say  dick      ”

“yes ”

“im not quite happy about his bad degree  of course i dont attach a
superstitious value to examination results any more than you do  still
      we have made one or two unfortunate elections lately ” almost
involuntarily as he said this  curry glanced across the room to where
pelham sat—pelham with his little button-like mouth and his pudding
face  pelham was a sound man  but even curry found it difficult to
remember anything that pelham had ever done or said 

“yes  i know ” said feverstone  “but even our worst elections arent
quite so dim as those the college makes when we leave it to itself ”

perhaps because the intolerable noise had frayed his nerves  curry felt
a momentary doubt about the “dimness” of these outsiders  he had dined
recently at northumberland and found telford dining there the same
night  the contrast between the alert and witty telford whom everyone at
northumberland seemed to know  whom everyone listened to  and the “dim”
telford in bracton common room had perplexed him  could it be that the
silences of all these “outsiders” in his own college  their monosyllabic
replies when he condescended and their blank faces when he assumed his
confidential manner  had an explanation which had never occurred to him 
the fantastic suggestion that he  curry  might be a bore  passed through
his mind so swiftly that a second later he had forgotten it forever  the
much less painful suggestion that these traditionalists and research
beetles affected to look down on him was retained  but feverstone was
shouting at him again 

“im going to be at cambridge next week ” he said  “in fact im giving a
dinner  id as soon it wasnt mentioned here  because  as a matter of
fact  the p m  may be coming  and one or two big newspaper people and
tony dew  what  oh  of course you know tony  that little dark man from
the bank  laird is going to be there  hes some kind of cousin of the
p m s  i was wondering if you could join us  i know davids very
anxious to meet you  hes heard a lot about you from some chap who used
to go to your lectures  i cant remember the name ”

“well  it would be very difficult  it rather depends on when old bills
funeral is to be  i should have to be here for that of course  was there
anything about the inquest on the six oclock news ”

“i didnt hear  but  of course  that raises a second question  now that
the blizzard has gone to blow in a better world  we have  two 
vacancies ”

“i cant hear ” yelled curry  “is this noise getting worse  or am i
getting deaf ”

“i say  sub-warden ” shouted ted raynor from beyond feverstone  “what
the devil are your friends outside doing ”

“cant they work without shouting ” asked someone else 

“it doesnt sound like work at all to me ” said a third 

“listen ” said glossop suddenly  “thats not work  listen to the feet 
its more like a game of rugger ”

“its getting worse every minute ” said raynor 

next moment nearly everyone in the room was on his feet  “what was
that ” shouted one  “theyre murdering someone ” said glossop  “theres
only one way of getting a noise like that out of a mans throat ” “where
are you going ” asked curry  “im going to see whats happening ” said
glossop  “curry  go and collect all the shooters in college  someone
ring up the police ” “i shouldnt go out if i were you ” said
feverstone  who had remained seated and was pouring himself out another
glass of wine  “it sounds as if the police  or something  was there
already ”

“what do you mean ”

“listen  there ”

“i thought that was their infernal drill ”

“listen ”

“my god       you really think its a machine-gun ”

“look out  look out ” said a dozen voices at once as a splintering of
glass became audible and a shower of stones fell onto the common room
floor  a moment later several of the fellows had made a rush for the
windows and put up the shutters  and then they were all standing staring
at one another  and silent but for the noise of their heavy breathing 
glossop had a cut on the forehead  and on the floor lay the fragments of
that famous east window on which henrietta maria had once cut her name
with a diamond

next morning mark went back to belbury by train  he had promised his
wife to clear up a number of points about his salary and place of
residence  and the memory of all these promises made a little cloud of
uneasiness in his mind  but on the whole he was in good spirits  this
return to belbury—just sauntering in and hanging up his hat and ordering
a drink—was a pleasant contrast to his first arrival  the servant who
brought the drink knew him  filostrato nodded to him  women  would 
fuss  but this was clearly the real world  after the drink he strolled
upstairs to cossers office  he was there for only five minutes  and
when he came out his state of mind had been completely altered 

steele and cosser were both there and both looked up with the air of men
who have been interrupted by a total stranger  neither spoke 

“ah—good morning ” said mark awkwardly 

steele finished making a pencil note on some large document which was
spread out before him 

“what is it  mr  studdock ” he said without looking up 

“i came to see cosser ” said mark  and then  addressing cosser  “ive
just been thinking over the last section but one in that report——”

“what reports this ” said steele to cosser 

“oh  i thought ” replied cosser  with a little twisty smile at one
corner of his mouth  “that it would be a good thing to put together a
report on cure hardy in my spare time  and as there was nothing
particular to do yesterday i drew it up  mr  studdock helped me ”

“well  never mind about that now ” said steele  “you can talk to mr 
cosser about it some other time  mr  studdock  im afraid hes busy at
present ”

“look here ” said mark  “i think wed better understand one another  am
i to take it that this report was simply a private hobby of cossers 
and if so  i should like to have known that before i spent eight hours
work on it  and whose orders am i under ”

steele  playing with his pencil  looked at cosser 

“i asked you a question about my position  mr  steele ” said mark 

“i havent time for this sort of thing ” said steele  “if you havent
any work to do  i have  i know nothing about your position ”

mark thought  for a moment  of turning to cosser  but cossers smooth 
freckled face and non-committal eyes suddenly filled him with such
contempt that he turned on his heel and left the room  slamming the door
behind him  he was going to see the deputy director 

at the door of withers room he hesitated for a moment because he heard
voices from within  but he was too angry to wait  he knocked and entered
without noticing whether the knock had been answered 

“my dear boy ” said the deputy director  looking up but not quite fixing
his eyes on marks face  “i am delighted to see you ” as he heard these
words mark noticed that there was a third person in the room  it was a
man called stone whom he had met at dinner the day before yesterday 
stone was standing in front of withers table rolling and unrolling a
piece of blotting-paper with his fingers  his mouth was open  his eyes
fixed on the deputy director 

“delighted to see you ” repeated wither  “all the more so because
you—er—interrupted me in what i am afraid i must call a rather painful
interview  as i was just saying to poor mr  stone when you came in 
nothing is nearer to my heart than the wish that this great institute
should all work together like one family       the greatest unity of
will and purpose  mr  stone  the freest mutual confidence       that is
what i expect of my colleagues  but then as you may remind me 
mr —ah—studdock  even in family life there are occasionally strains and
frictions and misunderstandings  and that is why  my dear boy  i am not
at the moment quite at leisure—dont go  mr  stone  i have a great deal
more to say to you ”

“perhaps id better come back later ” said mark 

“well  perhaps in all the circumstances       it is  your  feelings that
i am considering  mr  stone       perhaps       the usual method of
seeing me  mr  studdock  is to apply to my secretary and make an
appointment  not  you will understand  that i have the least wish to
insist on any formalities or would be other than pleased to see you
whenever you looked in  it is the waste of  your  time that i am anxious
to avoid ”

“thank you  sir ” said mark  “ill go and see your secretary ”

the secretarys office was next door  when one went in one found not the
secretary himself but a number of subordinates who were cut off from
their visitors behind a sort of counter  mark made an appointment for
ten oclock to-morrow which was the earliest hour they could offer him 
as he came out he ran into fairy hardcastle 

“hullo  studdock ” said the fairy  “hanging round the d d s office 
that wont do  you know ”

“i have decided ” said mark  “that i must either get my position
definitely fixed once and for all or else leave the institute ”

she looked at him with an ambiguous expression in which amusement seemed
to predominate  then she suddenly slipped her arm through his 

“look  sonny ” she said  “you drop all that  see  it isnt going to do
you any good  you come along and have a talk with me ”

“theres really nothing to talk about  miss hardcastle ” said mark  “im
quite clear in my mind  either i get a real job here  or i go back to
bracton  thats simple enough  i dont even particularly mind which  so
long as i know ”

to this the fairy made no answer  and the steady pressure of her arm
compelled mark  unless he was prepared to struggle  to go with her along
the passage  the intimacy and authority of her grip was ludicrously
ambiguous  and would have fitted almost equally well the relations of
policeman and prisoner  mistress and lover  nurse and child  mark felt
that he would look a fool if they met anyone 

she brought him to her own offices which were on the second floor  the
outer office was full of what he had already learned to call waips  the
girls of the womens auxiliary institutional police  the men of the
force  though very much more numerous  were not so often met with
indoors  but waips were constantly seen flitting to and fro wherever
miss hardcastle appeared  far from sharing the masculine characteristics
of their chief they were  as feverstone once said  “feminine to the
point of imbecility”—small and slight and fluffy and full of giggles 
miss hardcastle behaved to them as if she were a man  and addressed them
in tones of half breezy  half ferocious gallantry  “cocktails  dolly ”
she bawled as they entered the outer office  when they reached the inner
office she made mark sit down but remained standing herself with her
back to the fire and her legs wide apart  the drinks were brought and
dolly retired  closing the door behind her  mark had grumblingly told
his grievance on the way 

“cut it all out  studdock ” said miss hardcastle  “and whatever you do 
dont go bothering the d d  i told you before that you neednt worry
about all those little third-floor people provided youve got him on
your side  which you have at present  but you wont have if you keep on
going to him with complaints ”

“that might be very good advice  miss hardcastle ” said mark  “if i were
committed to staying here at all  but im not  and from what ive seen i
dont like the place  ive very nearly made up my mind to go home  only
i thought id just have a talk with him first  to make everything
clear ”

“making things clear is the one thing the d d  cant stand ” replied
miss hardcastle  “thats not how he runs the place  and mind you  he
knows what hes about  it works  sonny  youve no idea yet how well it
works  as for leaving       youre not superstitious  are you  i am  i
dont think its lucky to leave the n i c e  you neednt bother your
head about all the steeles and cossers  thats part of your
apprenticeship  youre being put through it at the moment  but if you
hold on youll come out above them  all youve got to do is to sit
tight  not one of them is going to be left when we get going ”

“thats just the sort of line cosser took about steele ” said mark  “and
it didnt seem to do me much good when it came to the point ”

“do you know  studdock ” said miss hardcastle  “ive taken a fancy to
you  and its just as well i have  because if i hadnt  id be disposed
to resent that last remark ”

“i dont mean to be offensive ” said mark  “but—damn it all—look at it
from my point of view ”

“no good  sonny ” said miss hardcastle  shaking her head  “you dont
know enough facts yet for your point of view to be worth sixpence  you
havent yet realised what youre in on  youre being offered a chance of
something far bigger than a seat in the cabinet  and there are only two
alternatives  you know  either to be in the n i c e  or to be out of it 
and i know better than you which is going to be most fun ”

“i  do  understand that ” said mark  “but anything is better than being
nominally in and having nothing to do  give me a real place in the
sociological department and ill      ”

“rats  that whole department is going to be scrapped  it had to be there
at the beginning for propaganda purposes  but theyre all going to be
weeded out ”

“but what assurance have i that im going to be one of their
successors ”

“you arent  theyre not going to have any successors  the real work has
nothing to do with all these departments  the kind of sociology were
interested in will be done by my people—the police ”

“then where do i come in ”

“if youll trust me ” said the fairy  putting down her empty glass and
producing a cheroot  “i can put you on to a bit of your real work—what
you were really brought here to do—straight away ”

“whats that ”

“alcasan ” said miss hardcastle between her teeth  she had started one
of her interminable dry smokes  then  glancing at mark with a hint of
contempt  “you know who im talking about  dont you ”

“you mean the radiologist—the man who was guillotined ” asked mark  who
was completely bewildered 

the fairy nodded 

“hes to be rehabilitated ” she said  “gradually  ive got all the facts
in the dossier  you begin with a quiet little article—not questioning
his guilt  not at first  but just hinting that of course he  was  a
member of their quisling government  and there was a prejudice against
him  say you dont doubt the verdict was just  but its disquieting to
realise that it would almost certainly have been the same even if hed
been innocent  then you follow it up in a day or two with an article of
quite a different kind  popular account of the value of his work  you
can mug up the facts—enough for  that  kind of article—in an afternoon 
then a letter  rather indignant  to the paper that printed the first
article  and going much further  the execution  was  a miscarriage of
justice  by that time——”

“what on earth is the point of all this ”

“im telling you  studdock  alcasan is to be rehabilitated  made into a
martyr  an irreparable loss to the human race ”

“but what for ”

“there you go again  you grumble about being given nothing to do  and as
soon as i suggest a bit of real work you expect to have the whole plan
of campaign told you before you do it  it doesnt make sense  thats not
the way to get on here  the great thing is to do what youre told  if
you turn out to be any good youll soon understand whats going on  but
youve got to begin by doing the work  you dont seem to realise what we
are  were an army ”

“anyway ” said mark  “im not a journalist  i didnt come here to write
newspaper articles  i tried to make that clear to feverstone at the very
beginning ”

“the sooner you drop all that talk about what you came here to do  the
better youll get on  im speaking for your own good  studdock  you
 can  write  thats one of the things youre wanted for ”

“then ive come here under a misunderstanding ” said mark  the sop to
his literary vanity  at that period of his career  by no means
compensated for the implication that his sociology was of no importance 
“ive no notion of spending my life writing newspaper articles ” he
said  “and if i had  id want to know a good deal more about the
politics of the n i c e  before i went in for that sort of thing ”

“havent you been told that its strictly non-political ”

“ive been told so many things that i dont know whether im on my head
or my heels ” said mark  “but i dont see how ones going to start a
newspaper stunt  which is about what this comes to  without being
political  is it left or right papers that are going to print all this
rot about alcasan ”

“both  honey  both ” said miss hardcastle  “dont you understand
 anything   isnt it absolutely essential to keep a fierce left and a
fierce right both on their toes and each terrified of the other  thats
how we get things done  any opposition to the n i c e  is represented as
a left racket in the right papers and a right racket in the left papers 
if its properly done you get each side out-bidding the other in support
of us—to refute the enemy slanders   of course  were non-political  the
real power always is ”

“i dont believe you can do that ” said mark  “not with the papers that
are read by educated people ”

“that shows youre still in the nursery  lovey ” said miss hardcastle 
“havent you yet realised that its the other way round ”

“how do you mean ”

“why  you fool  its the educated readers who  can  be gulled  all our
difficulty comes with the others  when did you meet a workman who
believes the papers  he takes it for granted that theyre all propaganda
and skips the leading articles  he buys his paper for the football
results and the little paragraphs about girls falling out of windows and
corpses found in mayfair flats  he is our problem  we have to
recondition him  but the educated public  the people who read the
highbrow weeklies  dont need reconditioning  theyre all right already 
theyll believe anything ”

“as one of the class you mention ” said mark with a smile  “i just dont
believe it ”

“good lord ” said the fairy  “where are your eyes  look at what the
weeklies have got away with  look at the  weekly question   theres a
paper for you  when basic english came in simply as the invention of a
free-thinking cambridge don  nothing was too good for it  as soon as it
was taken up by a tory prime minister it became a menace to the purity
of our language  and wasnt the monarchy an expensive absurdity for ten
years  and then  when the duke of windsor abdicated  didnt the
 question  go all monarchist and legitimist for about a fortnight  did
they drop a single reader  dont you see that the educated reader
 cant  stop reading the highbrow weeklies whatever they do  he cant 
hes been conditioned ”

“well ” said mark  “this is all very interesting  miss hardcastle  but
it has nothing to do with me  in the first place  i dont want to become
a journalist at all  and if i did i should like to be an honest
journalist ”

“very well ” said miss hardcastle  “all youll do is to help to ruin
this country  and perhaps the whole human race  besides dishing your own
career ”

the confidential tone in which she had been speaking up till now had
disappeared and there was a threatening finality in her voice  the
citizen and the honest man which had been awaked in mark by the
conversation  quailed a little  his other and far stronger self  the
self that was anxious at all costs not to be placed among the outsiders 
leaped up  fully alarmed 

“i dont mean ” he said  “that i dont see your point  i was only
wondering      ”

“its all one to me  studdock ” said miss hardcastle  seating herself at
last at her table  “if you dont like the job  of course  thats your
affair  go and settle it with the d d  he doesnt  like  people
resigning  but  of course  you can  hell have something to say to
feverstone for bringing you here  wed assumed you understood ”

the mention of feverstone brought sharply before mark as a reality the
plan  which had up till now been slightly unreal  of going back to
edgestow and satisfying himself with the career of a fellow of bracton 
on what terms would he go back  would he still be a member of the inner
circle even at bracton  to find himself no longer in the confidence of
the progressive element  to be thrust down among the telfords and
jewels  seemed to him unendurable  and the salary of a mere don looked a
poor thing after the dreams he had been dreaming for the last few days 
married life was already turning out more expensive than he had
reckoned  then came a sharp doubt about that two hundred pounds for
membership of the n i c e  club  but no—that was absurd  they couldnt
possibly dun him for that 

“well  obviously ” he said in a vague voice  “the first thing is to see
the d d ”

“now that youre leaving ” said the fairy  “theres one thing ive got
to say  ive laid all the cards on the table  if it should ever enter
your head that it would be fun to repeat any of this conversation in the
outer world  take my advice and dont  it wouldnt be at all healthy for
your future career ”

“oh  but of course ” began mark 

“youd better run along now ” said miss hardcastle  “have a nice talk
with the d d  be careful not to annoy the old man  he does so hate
resignations ”

mark made an attempt to prolong the interview  but the fairy did not
permit this and in a few seconds he was outside the door 

the rest of that day he passed miserably enough  keeping out of peoples
way as much as possible lest his lack of occupation should be noticed 
he went out before lunch for one of those short  unsatisfactory walks
which a man takes in a strange neighbourhood when he has brought with
him neither old clothes nor a walking-stick  after lunch he explored the
grounds  but they were not the sort of grounds that anyone could walk in
for pleasure  the edwardian millionaire who had built belbury had
enclosed about twenty acres with a low brick wall surmounted by an iron
railing  and laid it all out in what his contractor called ornamental
pleasure grounds  there were trees dotted about and winding paths
covered so thickly with round white pebbles that you could hardly walk
on them  there were immense flower-beds  some oblong  some
lozenge-shaped  and some crescents  there were plantations—slabs would
be almost a better word—of that kind of laurel which looks as if it were
made of cleverly painted and varnished metal  massive summer seats of
bright green stood at regular intervals along the paths  the whole
effect was like that of a municipal cemetery  yet  unattractive as it
was  he sought it again after tea  smoking incessantly  though the wind
blew the lit part down the side of his cigarette  and his tongue was
already burning  this time he wandered round to the back parts of the
house where the newer and lower buildings joined it  here he was
surprised by a stable-like smell and a medley of growls  grunts  and
whimpers—all the signs  in fact  of a considerable zoo  at first he did
not understand  but presently he remembered that an immense programme of
vivisection  freed at last from red tape and from niggling economy  was
one of the plans of the n i c e  he had not been particularly interested
and had thought vaguely of rats  rabbits  and an occasional dog  the
confused noises from within suggested something very different  as he
stood there one great yawn-like howl arose  and then  as if it had set
the key  all manner of trumpetings  bayings  screams  laughter even 
which shuddered and protested for a moment and then died away into
mutterings and whines  mark had no scruples about vivisection  what the
noise meant to him was the greatness and grandiosity of this whole
undertaking from which  apparently  he was likely to be excluded  there
were all sorts of things in there  hundreds of pounds worth of living
animality  which the institute could afford to cut up like paper on the
mere off-chance of some interesting discovery  he  must  get the job  he
must somehow solve the problem of steele  but the noise was disagreeable
and he moved away 


                                   ii

mark woke next morning with the feeling that there would certainly be
one fence and perhaps two fences for him to get over during the day  the
first was his interview with the deputy director  unless he could get a
very definite assurance about a post and a salary  he would cut his
connection with the institute  and then  when he reached home  the
second fence would be his explanation to jane of how the whole dream had
faded away 

the first real fog of the autumn had descended on belbury that morning 
mark ate his breakfast by artificial light  and neither post nor
newspaper had arrived  it was a friday and a servant handed him his bill
for the portion of a week which he had already spent in the institute 
he put it in his pocket after a hasty glance with a resolution that
this  at any rate  should never be mentioned to jane  neither the total
nor the items were of the sort that wives easily understand  he himself
doubted whether there were not some mistake  but he was still at that
age when a man would rather be fleeced to his last penny than dispute a
bill  then he finished his second cup of tea  felt for cigarettes  found
none  and ordered a new packet 

the odd half-hour which he had to wait before keeping his appointment
with the deputy director passed slowly  no one spoke to him  everyone
else seemed to be hasting away on some important and well-defined
purpose  for part of the time he was alone in the lounge and felt that
the servants looked at him as if he ought not to be there  he was glad
when he was able to go upstairs and knock on withers door 

he was admitted at once  but the conversation was not easy to begin
because wither said nothing  and though he looked up as soon as mark
entered  with an expression of dreamy courtesy  he did not look exactly
at mark  nor did he ask him to sit down  the room  as usual  was
extremely hot  and mark  divided between his desire to make it clear
that he had fully resolved to be left hanging about no longer and his
equally keen desire not to lose the job if there were any real job
going  did not perhaps speak very well  at all events the deputy
director left him to run down—to pass into disjointed repetitions and
thence into complete silence  that silence lasted for some time  wither
sat with his lips pouted and slightly open as though he were humming a
tune 

“so i think  sir  id better go ” said mark at last  with vague
reference to what he had been saying 

“you are mr  studdock i think ” said wither tentatively after another
prolonged silence 

“yes ” said mark impatiently  “i called on you with lord feverstone a
few days ago  you gave me to understand that you were offering me a
position on the sociological side of the n i c e  but as i was saying——”

“one moment  mr  studdock ” interrupted the deputy director  “it is so
important to be perfectly clear what we are doing  you are no doubt
aware that in certain senses of the words it would be most unfortunate
to speak of my offering anyone a post in the institute  you must not
imagine for a moment that i hold any kind of autocratic position  nor 
on the other hand  that the relation between my own sphere of influence
and the powers—i am speaking of their temporary powers  you
understand—of the permanent committee or those of the director himself
are defined by any hard and fast system of what—er—one might call a
constitutional  or even a constitutive  character  for example——”

“then  sir  can you tell me whether anyone has offered me a post  and 
if so  who ”

“oh ” said wither suddenly  changing both his position and his tone as
if a new idea had struck him  “there has never been the least question
of that sort  it was always understood that your co-operation with the
institute would be entirely acceptable—would be of the greatest value ”

“well  can i—i mean  oughtnt we to discuss the details  i mean the
salary for example and—who should i be working under ”

“my dear friend ” said wither with a smile  “i do not anticipate that
there will be any difficulty about the—er—the financial side of the
matter  as for——”

“what would the salary be  sir ” said mark 

“well  there you touch on a point which it is hardly for me to decide  i
believe that members in the position which we had envisaged you as
occupying usually draw some sum like fifteen hundred a year  allowing
for fluctuations calculated on a very liberal basis  you will find that
all questions of that sort will adjust themselves with the greatest
ease ”

“but when should i know  sir  who ought i to go to about it ”

“you mustnt suppose  mr  studdock  that when i mention fifteen hundred
i am at all excluding the possibility of some higher figure  i dont
think any of us here would allow a disagreement on that point      ”

“i should be perfectly satisfied with fifteen hundred ” said mark  “i
wasnt thinking of that at all  but—but—” the deputy directors
expression became more and more courtly and confidential as mark
stammered  so that when he finally blurted out  “i suppose thered be a
contract or something of the kind ” he felt he had committed an
unutterable vulgarity 

“well ” said the deputy director  fixing his eyes on the ceiling and
sinking his voice to a whisper as though he too were profoundly
embarrassed  “that is not exactly the sort of procedure       it would 
no doubt  be possible      ”

“and that isnt the main point  sir ” said mark reddening  “theres the
question of my status  am i to work under mr  steele ”

“i have here a form ” said wither  opening a drawer  “which has not  i
believe  been ever actually used but which was designed for such
agreements  you might care to study it at your leisure and if you are
satisfied we could sign it at any time ”

“but about mr  steele ”

at that moment a secretary entered and placed some letters on the deputy
directors table 

“ah  the post at last ” said wither  “perhaps  mr  studdock  er—you will
have letters of your own to attend to  you are  i believe  married ” a
smile of fatherly indulgence overspread his face as he said these words 

“im sorry to delay you  sir ” said mark  “but about mr  steele  there
is no good my looking at the form of agreement until that question is
settled  i should feel compelled to refuse any position which involved
working under mr  steele ”

“that opens up a very interesting question about which i should like to
have a quite informal and confidential chat with you on some future
occasion ” said wither  “for the moment  mr  studdock  i shall not
regard anything you have said as final  if you care to call on me
to-morrow      ” he became absorbed in the letter he had opened  and
mark  feeling that he had achieved enough for one interview  left the
room  apparently they did really want him at the n i c e  and were
prepared to pay a high price for him  he would fight it out about steele
later  meanwhile he would study the form of agreement 

he came downstairs again and found the following letter waiting for him 

                                                        bracton college 
                                                               edgestow 
                                                        oct  20th  19—  

  “my dear mark —we were all sorry to hear from dick that you are
  resigning your fellowship  but feel quite certain youve made the
  right decision as far as your own career is concerned  once the
  n i c e  is settled in here i shall expect to see almost as much of
  you as before  if you have not yet sent a formal resignation to n o  
  i shouldnt be in any hurry to do so  if you wrote early next term the
  vacancy would come up at the february meeting and we should have time
  to get ready a suitable candidate as your successor  have you any
  ideas on the subject yourself  i was talking to james and dick the
  other night about david laird  james hadnt heard of him before   no
  doubt you know his work  could you let me have a line about it  and
  about his more general qualifications  i may see him next week when
  im running over to cambridge to dine with the prime minister and one
  or two others  and i think dick might be induced to ask laird as well 
  youll have heard that we had rather a shindy here the other night 
  there was apparently some sort of  fracas  between the new workmen and
  the local inhabitants  the n i c e  police  who seem to be a nervy
  lot  made the mistake of firing a few rounds over the head of the
  crowd  we had the henrietta maria window smashed and several stones
  came into common room  glossop lost his head and wanted to go out and
  harangue the mob  but i managed to quiet him down  this is in strict
  confidence  there are lots of people ready to make capital out of it
  here and to get up a hue and cry against us for selling the wood  in
  haste—i must run off and make arrangements about hingests
  funeral —yours  g  c  curry ”

at the first words of this letter a stab of fear ran through mark  he
tried to reassure himself  an explanation of the misunderstanding—which
he would write and post immediately—would be bound to put everything
right  they couldnt shove a man out of his fellowship simply on a
chance word spoken by lord feverstone in common room  it came back to
him with miserable insight that what he was now calling “a chance word”
was exactly what he had learned  in the progressive element  to describe
as “settling real business in private” or “cutting out the red tape ”
but he tried to thrust this out of his mind  it came back to him that
poor conington had actually lost his job in a way very similar to this 
but he explained to himself that the circumstances had been quite
different  conington had been an outsider  he was inside  even more
inside than curry himself  but was he  if he were not “inside” at
belbury  and it began to look as if he were not  was he still in
feverstones confidence  if he had to go back to bracton would he find
that he retained even his old status there   could  he go to bracton 
yes  of course  he must write a letter at once explaining that he had
not resigned  and would not resign  his fellowship  he sat down at a
table in the writing-room and took out his pen  then another thought
struck him  a letter to curry  saying plainly that he meant to stay at
bracton  would be shown to feverstone  feverstone would tell wither 
such a letter could be regarded as a refusal of any post at belbury 
well—let it be  he would give up this short-lived dream and fall back on
his fellowship  but how if that were impossible  the whole thing might
have been arranged simply to let him fall between the two stools—kicked
out of belbury because he was retaining the bracton fellowship and
kicked out of bracton because he was supposed to be taking a job at
belbury       then he and jane left to sink or swim with not a  sou 
between them       perhaps with feverstones influence against him when
he tried to get another job  and where  was  feverstone 

obviously  he must play his cards very carefully  he rang the bell and
ordered a large whisky  at home he would not have drunk till twelve and
even then would have drunk only beer  but now       and anyway  he felt
curiously chilly  there was no point in catching a cold on top of all
his other troubles 

he decided that he must write a very careful and rather elusive letter 
his first draught was  he thought  not vague enough  it could be used as
a proof that he had abandoned all idea of a job at belbury  he must make
it vaguer  but then  if it were too vague  it would do no good  oh damn 
damn  damn the whole thing  the two hundred pounds entrance fee  the
bill for his first week  and snatches of imagined attempts to make jane
see the whole episode in the proper light  kept coming between him and
his task  in the end  with the aid of the whisky and of a great many
cigarettes  he produced the following letter 

  “the national institute for co-ordinated experiments 
  belbury 

                                                        oct  21st  19—  

  my dear curry —feverstone must have got me wrong  i never made the
  slightest suggestion of resigning my fellowship and dont in the least
  wish to do so  as a matter of fact  i have almost made up my mind not
  to take a full-time job with the n i c e  and hope to be back in
  college in a day or two  for one thing  i am rather worried about my
  wifes health  and dont like to commit myself to being much away at
  present  in the second place  though everyone here has been extremely
  flattering and all press me to stay  the kind of job they want me for
  is more on the administrative and publicity side and less scientific
  than i had expected  so be sure and contradict it if you hear anyone
  saying i am thinking of leaving edgestow  i hope youll enjoy your
  jaunt to cambridge  what circles you do move in —yours  mark g 
  studdock 

   p s  —laird wouldnt have done in any case  he got a third  and the
  only published work hes ventured on has been treated as a joke by
  serious reviewers  in particular  he has no  critical  faculty at all 
  you can always depend on him for admiring anything that is thoroughly
  bogus ”

the relief of having finished the letter was only momentary  for almost
as soon as he had sealed it the problem of how to pass the rest of this
day returned to him  he decided to go and sit in his own room  but when
he went up there he found the bed stripped and a vacuum cleaner in the
middle of the floor  apparently members were not expected to be in their
bedrooms at this time of day  he came down and tried the lounge  the
servants were tidying it  he looked into the library  it was empty but
for two men who were talking with their heads close together  they
stopped and looked up as soon as he entered  obviously waiting for him
to go  he pretended that he had come to get a book and retired  in the
hall he saw steele himself standing by the notice-board and talking to a
man with a pointed beard  neither looked at mark  but as he passed them
they became silent  he dawdled across the hall and pretended to examine
the barometer  wherever he went he heard doors opening and shutting  the
tread of rapid feet  occasional ringing of telephones  all the signs of
a busy institution carrying on a vigorous life from which he was
excluded  he opened the front door and looked out  the fog was thick 
wet  and cold 

there is one sense in which every narrative is false  it dare not
attempt  even if it could  to express the actual movement of time  this
day was so long to mark that a faithful account of it would be
unreadable  sometimes he sat upstairs—for at last they finished “doing”
his bedroom—sometimes he went out into the fog  sometimes he hung about
the public rooms  every now and then these would be unaccountably filled
up by crowds of talking people  and for a few minutes the strain of
trying not to look unoccupied  not to seem miserable and embarrassed 
would be imposed on him  then suddenly  as if summoned by their next
engagement  all these people would hurry away 

some time after lunch he met stone in one of the passages  mark had not
thought of him since yesterday morning  but now  looking at the
expression on his face and something furtive in his whole manner  he
realised that here  at any rate  was someone who felt as uncomfortable
as himself  stone had the look which mark had often seen before in
unpopular boys or new boys at school  in “outsiders” at bracton—the look
which was for mark the symbol of all his worst fears  for to be one who
must wear that look was  in his scale of values  the greatest evil  his
instinct was not to speak to this man stone  he knew by experience how
dangerous it is to be friends with a sinking man or even to be seen with
him  you cannot keep him afloat and he may pull you under  but his own
craving for companionship was now acute  so that against his better
judgement he smiled a sickly smile and said “hullo ”

stone gave a start as if to be spoken to were almost a frightening
experience  “good afternoon ” he said nervously and made to pass on 

“lets come and talk somewhere  if youre not busy ” said mark 

“i am—that is to say—im not quite sure how long i shall be free ” said
stone 

“tell me about this place ” said mark  “it seems to me perfectly bloody 
but i havent yet made up my mind  come to my room ”

“i dont think that at all  not at all  who said i thought that ”
answered stone very quickly  and mark did not answer because at that
moment he saw the deputy director approaching them  he was to discover
during the next few weeks that no passage and no public room at belbury
was ever safe from the prolonged indoor walks of the deputy director 
they could not be regarded as a form of espionage for the creak of
withers boots and the dreary little tune which he was nearly always
humming would have defeated any such purpose  one heard him quite a long
way off  often one saw him a long way off as well  for he was a tall
man—without his stoop he would have been very tall indeed—and often 
even in a crowd  one saw that face at a distance staring vaguely towards
one  but this was marks first experience of that ubiquity  and he felt
that the d d  could not have appeared at a more unfortunate moment  very
slowly he came towards them  looked in their direction though it was not
plain from his face whether he recognised them or not  and passed on 
neither of the young men attempted to resume their conversation 

at tea mark saw feverstone and went at once to sit beside him  he knew
that the worst thing a man in his position could do was to try to force
himself on anyone  but he was now feeling desperate 

“i say  feverstone ” he began gaily  “im in search of information”—and
was relieved to see feverstone smile in reply 

“yes ” said mark  “i havent had exactly what youd call a glowing
reception from steele  but the d d  wont hear of my leaving  and the
fairy seems to want me to write newspaper articles  what the hell  am  i
supposed to be doing ”

feverstone laughed long and loud 

“because ” concluded mark  “im damned if i can find out  ive tried to
tackle the old boy direct      ”

“god ” said feverstone  laughing even louder 

“can one  never  get anything out of him ”

“not what  you  want ” said feverstone with a chuckle 

“well  how the devil is one to find out whats wanted if nobody offers
any information ”

“quite ”

“oh  and by the way  that reminds me of something else  how on earth did
curry get hold of the idea that im resigning my fellowship ”

“arent you ”

“i never had the faintest notion of resigning it ”

“really  i was told distinctly by the fairy that you werent coming
back ”

“you dont suppose id do it through her if i  was  going to resign ”

feverstones smile brightened and widened  “it doesnt make any odds 
you know ” he said  “if the n i c e  want you to have a nominal job
somewhere outside belbury  youll have one  and if they dont  you
wont  just like that ”

“damn the n i c e  im merely trying to retain the fellowship i already
had  which is no concern of theirs  one doesnt want to fall between two
stools ”

“one doesnt  want  to ”

“you mean ”

“take my advice and get into withers good books again as soon as you
can  i gave you a good start but you seem to have rubbed him up the
wrong way  his attitude has changed since this morning  you need to
humour him  you know  and just between ourselves  i wouldnt be too
thick with the fairy  it wont do you any good higher up  there are
wheels within wheels ”

“in the meantime ” said mark  “ive written to curry to explain that
its all rot about my resignation ”

“no harm if it amuses you ” said feverstone  still smiling 

“well  i dont suppose college wants to kick me out simply because curry
misunderstood something miss hardcastle said to you ”

“you  cant  be deprived of a fellowship under any statute i know 
except for gross immorality ”

“no  of course not  i didnt mean that  i meant not being re-elected
when i come up for re-election next term ”

“oh  i see ”

“and thats why i must rely on you to get that idea out of currys
head ”

feverstone said nothing 

“you will be sure ” urged mark against his own better judgement  “to
make it quite clear to him that the whole thing was a misunderstanding ”

“dont you know curry  he will have got his whole wangling-machine going
on the problem of your successor long ago ”

“thats why i am relying on you to stop him ”

“me ”

“yes ”

“why me ”

“well—damn it all  feverstone  it was you who first put the idea into
his head ”

“do you know ” said feverstone  helping himself to a muffin  “i find
your style of conversation rather difficult  you will come up for
re-election in a few months  the college may decide to re-elect you  or 
of course  it may not  as far as i can make out  you are at present
attempting to canvass my vote in advance  to which the proper answer is
the one i now give—go to hell ”

“you know perfectly well that there was no doubt about my re-election
until you spoke a word in currys ear ”

feverstone eyed the muffin critically  “you make me rather tired ” he
said  “if you dont know how to steer your own course in a place like
bracton  why come and pester me  im not a bucking nurse  and for your
own good i would advise you in talking to people here to adopt a more
agreeable manner than you are using now  otherwise your life may be  in
the famous words  nasty  poor  brutish  and short ”

“short ” said mark  “is that a threat  do you mean my life at bracton or
at the n i c e  ”

“i shouldnt stress the distinction too much if i were you ” said
feverstone 

“i shall remember that ” said mark  rising from his chair  as he made to
move away he could not help turning to this smiling man once again and
saying  “it was you who brought me here  i thought you at least were my
friend ”

“incurable romantic ” said lord feverstone  deftly extending his mouth
to an even wider grin and popping the muffin into it entire 

and so mark knew that if he lost the belbury job he would lose his
fellowship at bracton as well

during these days jane spent as little time as possible in the flat and
kept herself awake reading in bed  as long as she could  each night 
sleep had become her enemy  in the daytime she kept on going to
edgestow—nominally in the attempt to find another “woman who would come
in twice a week” instead of mrs  maggs  on one of these occasions she
was delighted to find herself suddenly addressed by camilla denniston 
camilla had just stepped out of a car and next moment she introduced a
tall dark man as her husband  jane saw at once that both the dennistons
were the sort of people she liked  she knew that mr  denniston had once
been a friend of marks but she had never met him  and her first thought
was to wonder  as she had wondered before  why marks present friends
were so inferior to those he once had  carey and wadsden and the
taylors  who had all been members of the set in which she first got to
know him  had been nicer than curry and busby  not to mention the
feverstone man—and this mr  denniston was obviously very much nicer
indeed 

“we were just coming to see you ” said camilla  “look here  we have
lunch with us  lets drive you up to the woods beyond sandown and all
feed together in the car  theres lots to talk about ”

“or what about your coming to the flat and lunching with me ” said jane 
inwardly wondering how she could manage this  “its hardly a day for
picnicking ”

“that only means extra washing-up for you ” said camilla  “had we better
go somewhere in town  arthur —if mrs  studdock thinks its too cold and
foggy ”

“a restaurant would hardly do  mrs  studdock ” said denniston  “we want
to be private ” the “we” obviously meant “we three” and established at
once a pleasant  business-like unity between them  “as well ” he
continued  “dont you like a rather foggy day in a wood in autumn 
youll find we shall be perfectly warm sitting in the car ”

jane said shed never heard of anyone liking fogs before but she didnt
mind trying  all three got in 

“thats why camilla and i got married ” said denniston as they drove
off  “we both like weather  not this or that kind of weather  but just
weather  its a useful taste if one lives in england ”

“how ever did you learn to do that  mr  denniston ” said jane  “i dont
think i should ever learn to like rain and snow ”

“its the other way round ” said denniston  “everyone begins as a child
by liking weather  you learn the art of disliking it as you grow up 
havent you ever noticed it on a snowy day  the grown-ups are all going
about with long faces  but look at the children—and the dogs   they 
know what snows made for ”

“im sure i hated wet days as a child ” said jane 

“thats because the grown-ups kept you in ” said camilla  “any child
loves rain if its allowed to go out and paddle about in it ”

presently they left the unfenced road beyond sandown and went bumping
across grass and among trees and finally came to rest in a sort of
little grassy bay with a fir thicket on one side and a group of beeches
on the other  there were wet cobwebs and a rich autumnal smell all round
them  then all three sat together in the back of the car  and there was
some unstrapping of baskets  and then sandwiches and a little flask of
sherry and finally hot coffee and cigarettes  jane was beginning to
enjoy herself 

“now ” said camilla 

“well ” said denniston  “i suppose id better begin  you know  of
course  where weve come from  mrs  studdock ”

“from miss ironwoods ” said jane 

“well  from the same house  but we dont belong to grace ironwood  she
and we both belong to someone else ”

“yes ” said jane 

“our little household  or company  or society  or whatever you like to
call it is run by a mr  fisher-king  at least that is the name he has
recently taken  you might or might not know his original name if i told
it to you  he is a great traveller but now an invalid  he got a wound in
his foot on his last journey which wont heal ”

“how did he come to change his name ”

“he had a married sister in india  a mrs  fisher-king  she has just died
and left him a large fortune on condition that he took the name  she was
a remarkable woman in her way  a friend of the great native christian
mystic whom you may have heard of—the sura  and thats the point  the
sura had reason to believe  or thought he had reason to believe  that a
great danger was hanging over the human race  and just before the
end—just before he disappeared—he became convinced that it would
actually come to a head in this island  and after hed gone——”

“is he dead ” asked jane 

“that we dont know ” answered denniston  “some people think hes alive 
others not  at any rate he disappeared  and mrs  fisher-king more or
less handed over the problem to her brother  to our chief  that  in
fact  was why she gave him the money  he was to collect a company round
him to watch for this danger  and to strike when it came ”

“thats not quite right  arthur ” said camilla  “he was told that a
company would in fact collect round him and he was to be its head ”

“i didnt think we need go into that ” said arthur  “but i agree  and
now  mrs  studdock  this is where you come in ”

jane waited 

“the sura said that when the time came we should find what he called a
seer  a person with second sight ”

“not that wed  get  a seer  arthur ” said camilla  “that a seer would
turn up  either we or the other side would get her ”

“and it looks ” said denniston to jane  “as if you were the seer ”

“but please ” said jane  smiling  “i dont want to be anything so
exciting ”

“no ” said denniston  “its rough luck on you ” there was just the right
amount of sympathy in his tone 

camilla turned to jane and said  “i gathered from grace ironwood that
you werent quite convinced you  were  a seer  i mean you thought it
might be just ordinary dreams  do you still think that ”

“its all so strange and— beastly  ” said jane  she liked these people 
but her habitual inner prompter was whispering  “take care  dont get
drawn in  dont commit yourself to anything  youve got your own life to
live ” then an impulse of honesty forced her to add  “as a matter of
fact ive had another dream since then  and it turns out to have been
true  i saw the murder—mr  hingests murder ”

“there you are ” said camilla  “oh  mrs  studdock  you  must  come in 
you must  you must  that means were right on top of it now  dont you
see  weve been wondering all this time exactly where the trouble is
going to begin  and now your dream gives us a clue  youve seen
something within a few miles of edgestow  in fact  we are apparently in
the thick of it already—whatever it is  and we cant move an inch
without your help  you are our secret service  our eyes  its all been
arranged long before we were born  dont spoil everything  do join us ”

“no  cam  dont ” said denniston  “the pendragon—the head  i mean 
wouldnt like us to do that  mrs  studdock must come in freely ”

“but ” said jane  “i dont know anything about all this  do i  i dont
want to take sides in something i dont understand ”

“but dont you see ” broke in camilla  “that you cant be neutral  if
you dont give yourself to us  the enemy will use you ”

the words “give yourself to us” were ill chosen  the very muscles of
janes body stiffened a little  if the speaker had been anyone who
attracted her less than camilla she would have become like stone to any
further appeal  denniston laid a hand on his wifes arm 

“you must see it from mrs  studdocks point of view  dear ” he said 
“you forget she knows practically nothing at all about us  and that is
the real difficulty  we cant tell her much until she has joined  we
are  in fact  asking her to take a leap in the dark ” he turned to jane
with a slightly quizzical smile on his face which was  nevertheless 
grave  “it  is  like that ” he said  “like getting married  or going
into the navy as a boy  or becoming a monk  or trying a new thing to
eat  you cant know what its like until you take the plunge ” he did
not perhaps know  or again perhaps he did  the complicated resentments
and resistances which his choice of illustrations awoke in jane  nor
could she herself analyse them  she merely replied in a colder voice
than she had yet used 

“in that case it is rather difficult to see why one should take it at
all ”

“i admit frankly ” said denniston  “that you can only take it on trust 
it all depends really  i suppose  what impression the dimbles and grace
and we two have made on you  and  of course  the head himself  when you
meet  him  ”

jane softened again 

“what exactly are you asking me to do ” she said 

“to come and see our chief  first of all  and then—well  to join  it
would involve making certain promises to him  he is really a head  you
see  we have all agreed to take his orders  oh—theres one other thing 
what view would mark take about it —he and i are old friends  you know ”

“i wonder ” said camilla  “need we go into that for the moment ”

“its bound to come up sooner or later ” said her husband 

there was a little pause 

“mark ” said jane  “how does he come into it  i cant imagine what hed
say about all this  hed probably think we were all off our heads ”

“would he object  though ” said denniston  “i mean  would he object to
your joining us ”

“if he were at home  i suppose hed be rather surprised if i announced i
was going to stay indefinitely at st  annes  does joining you mean
that ”

“isnt mark at home ” asked denniston with some surprise 

“no ” said jane  “hes at belbury  i think hes going to have a job in
the n i c e ” she was rather pleased to be able to say this for she was
well aware of the distinction it implied  if denniston was impressed he
did not show it 

“i dont think ” he said  “that joining us would mean  at the moment 
coming to live at st  annes  specially in the case of a married woman 
unless old mark got really interested and came himself——”

“that is quite out of the question ” said jane   “he doesnt know mark ”
she thought  

“anyway ” continued denniston  “that is hardly the real point at the
moment  would he object to your joining—putting yourself under the
heads orders and making the promises and all that ”

“would he object ” asked jane  “what on earth would it have to do with
him ”

“well ” said denniston  hesitating a little  “the head—or the
authorities he obeys—have rather old-fashioned notions  he wouldnt like
a married woman to come in  if it could be avoided  without her
husbands—without consulting——”

“do you mean im to ask marks  permission  ” said jane with a strained
little laugh  the resentment which had been rising and ebbing  but
rising each time a little more than it ebbed  for several minutes  had
now overflowed  all this talk of promises and obedience to an unknown
mr  fisher-king had already repelled her  but the idea of this same
person sending her back to get marks permission—as if she were a child
asking leave to go to a party—was the climax  for a moment she looked on
mr  denniston with real dislike  she saw him  and mark  and the
fisher-king man and this preposterous indian fakir simply as
men—complacent  patriarchal figures making arrangements for women as if
women were children or bartering them like cattle   “and so the king
promised that if anyone killed the dragon he would  give  him his
daughter in marriage ”  she was very angry 

“arthur ” said camilla  “i see a light over there  do you think its a
bonfire ”

“yes  i should say it was ”

“my feet are getting cold  lets go for a little walk and look at the
fire  i wish we had some chestnuts ”

“oh  do lets ” said jane 

they got out  it was warmer in the open than it had by now become in the
car—warm and full of leavy smells  and dampness  and the small noise of
dripping branches  the fire was big and in its middle life—a smoking
hillside of leaves on one side and great caves and cliffs of glowing red
on the other  they stood round it and chatted of indifferent matters for
a time 

“ill tell you what ill do ” said jane presently  “i wont join
your—your—whatever it is  but ill promise to let you know if i have any
more dreams of that sort ”

“that is splendid ” said denniston  “and i think it is as much as we had
a right to expect  i quite see your point of view  may i ask for one
more promise ”

“what is that ”

“not to mention us to anyone ”

“oh  certainly ”

later  when they had returned to the car and were driving back  mr 
denniston said  “i hope the dreams will not  worry  you much  now  mrs 
studdock  no  i dont mean i hope theyll stop  and i dont think they
will either  but now that you know they are not something in yourself
but only things going on in the outer world  nasty things  no doubt  but
no worse than lots you read in the papers  i believe youll find them
quite bearable  the less you think of them as  your dreams  and the more
you think of them—well  as news—the better youll feel about them ”




                                  six
                                  fog

a night  with little sleep  and half another day dragged past before
mark was able to see the deputy director again  he went to him in a
chastened frame of mind  anxious to get the job on almost any terms 

“i have brought back the form  sir ” he said 

“what form ” asked the deputy director  mark found he was talking to a
new and different wither  the absent-mindedness was still there  but the
courtliness was gone  the man looked at him as if out of a dream  as if
divided from him by an immense distance  but with a sort of dreamy
distaste which might turn into active hatred if ever that distance were
diminished  he still smiled  but there was something cat-like in the
smile  an occasional alteration of the lines about the mouth which even
hinted at a snarl  mark in his hands was as a mouse  at bracton the
progressive element  having to face only scholars  had passed for very
knowing fellows  but here at belbury  one felt quite different  wither
said he had understood that mark had already refused the job  he could
not  in any event  renew the offer  he spoke vaguely and alarmingly of
strains and frictions  of injudicious behaviour  of the danger of making
enemies  of the impossibility that the n i c e could harbour a person
who appeared to have quarrelled with all its members in the first week 
he spoke even more vaguely and alarmingly of conversations he had had
with “your colleagues at bracton” which entirely confirmed this view  he
doubted if mark were really suited to a learned career  but disclaimed
any intention of giving advice  only after he had hinted and murmured
mark into a sufficient state of dejection did he throw him  like a bone
to a dog  the suggestion of an appointment for a probationary period at
 roughly—he could not commit the institute  six hundred a year  and mark
took it  he attempted to get answers even then to some of his questions 
from whom was he to take orders  was he to reside at belbury 

wither replied  “i think  mr  studdock  we have already mentioned
elasticity as the keynote of the institute  unless you are prepared to
treat membership as       er       a vocation rather than a mere
appointment  i could not conscientiously advise you to come to us  there
are no watertight compartments  i fear i could not persuade the
committee to invent for your benefit some cut-and-dried position in
which you would discharge artificially limited duties and  apart from
those  regard your time as your own  pray allow me to finish  mr 
studdock  we are  as i have said before  more like a family  or even 
perhaps  like a single personality  there must be no question of taking
your orders  as you  rather unfortunately  suggest  from some specified
official and considering yourself free to adopt an intransigent attitude
to your other colleagues   i must ask you not to interrupt me  please  
that is not the spirit in which i would wish you to approach your
duties  you must make yourself useful  mr  studdock—generally useful  i
do not think the institute could allow anyone to remain in it who showed
a disposition to stand on his rights       who grudged this or that
piece of service because it fell outside some function which he had
chosen to circumscribe by a rigid definition  on the other hand  it
would be quite equally disastrous       i mean for yourself  mr 
studdock  i am thinking throughout of your own interests       quite
equally disastrous if you allowed yourself ever to be distracted from
your real work by unauthorised collaboration       or  worse still 
interference       with the work of other members  do not let casual
suggestions distract you or dissipate your energies  concentration  mr 
studdock  concentration  and the free spirit of give and take  if you
avoid both the errors i have mentioned then       ah  i do not think i
need despair of correcting on your behalf certain unfortunate
impressions which  we must admit  your behaviour has already produced 
no  mr  studdock  i can allow no further discussion  my time is already
fully occupied  i cannot be continually harassed by conversations of
this sort  you must find your own level  mr  studdock  good morning  mr 
studdock  good morning  remember what i have said  i am trying to do all
i can for you  good morning ”

mark reimbursed himself for the humiliation of this interview by
reflecting that if he were not a married man he would not have borne it
for a moment  this seemed to him  though he did not put it into words 
to throw the burden upon jane  it also set him free to think of all the
things he would have said to wither if he hadnt had jane to bother
about—and would still say if ever he got a chance  this kept him in a
sort of twilight happiness for several minutes  and when he went to tea
he found that the reward for his submission had already begun  the fairy
signed to him to come and sit beside her 

“you havent done anything about alcasan yet ” she asked 

“no ” said mark  “because i hadnt really decided to stay  not until
this morning  i could come up and look at your materials this afternoon
      at least as far as i know  for i havent yet really found out what
im supposed to be doing ”

“elasticity  sonny  elasticity ” said miss hardcastle  “you never will 
your line is to do whatever youre told and above all not to bother the
old man ”


                                   ii

during the next few days several processes  which afterwards came to
seem important  were steadily going on 

the fog  which covered edgestow as well as belbury  continued and grew
denser  at edgestow one regarded it as “coming up from the river ” but
in reality it lay all over the heart of england  it blanketed the whole
town so that walls dripped and you could write your name in the dampness
on tables and men worked by artificial light at midday  the workings 
where bragdon wood had been  ceased to offend conservative eyes and
became mere clangings  thuddings  hootings  shouts  curses  and metallic
screams in an invisible world 

some felt glad that the obscenity should thus be covered  for all beyond
the wynd was now an abomination  the grip of the n i c e  on edgestow
was tightening  the river itself  which had once been brownish-green and
amber and smooth-skinned silver  tugging at the reeds and playing with
the red roots  now flowed opaque  thick with mud  sailed on by endless
fleets of empty tins  sheets of paper  cigarette ends  and fragments of
wood  sometimes varied by rainbow patches of oil  then the invasion
actually crossed it  the institute had bought the land up to the left or
eastern bank  but now busby was summoned to meet feverstone and a
professor frost as the representatives of the n i c e   and learned for
the first time that the wynd itself was to be diverted  there was to be
no river in edgestow  this was still strictly confidential  but the
institute had already powers to force it  this being so  a new
adjustment of boundaries between it and the college was clearly needed 
busbys jaw fell when he realised that the institute wanted to come
right up to the college walls  he refused  of course  and it was then
that he first heard a hint of requisitioning  the college could sell
to-day and the institute offered a good price  if they did not 
compulsion and a merely nominal compensation awaited them  relations
between feverstone and the bursar deteriorated during this interview  an
extraordinary college meeting had to be summoned  and busby had to put
the best face he could on things to his colleagues  he was almost
physically shocked by the storm of hatred which met him  in vain did he
point out that those who were now abusing him had themselves voted for
the sale of the wood  but equally in vain did they abuse him  the
college was caught in the net of necessity  they sold the little strip
on their side of the wynd which meant so much  it was no more than a
terrace between the eastern walls and the water  twenty-four hours later
the n i c e  boarded over the doomed wynd and converted the terrace into
a dump  all day long workmen were trampling across the planks with heavy
loads which they flung down against the very walls of bracton till the
pile had covered the boarded blindness which had once been the henrietta
maria window and reached almost to the east window of chapel 

in these days many members of the progressive element dropped off and
joined the opposition  those who were left were hammered closer together
by the unpopularity they had to face  and though the college was thus
sharply divided within  yet for the very same reason it also took on a
new unity perforce in its relations to the outer world  bracton as a
whole bore the blame for bringing the n i c e  to edgestow at all  this
was unfair  for many high authorities in the university had thoroughly
approved bractons action in doing so  but now that the result was
becoming apparent people refused to remember this  busby  though he had
heard the hint of requisitioning in confidence  lost no time in
spreading it through edgestow common rooms—“it would have done no good
if we  had  refused to sell ” he said  but nobody believed that this was
why bracton had sold  and the unpopularity of that college steadily
increased  the undergraduates got wind of it  and stopped attending the
lectures of bracton dons  busby  and even the wholly innocent warden 
were mobbed in the streets 

the town  which did not usually share the opinions of the university 
was also in an unsettled condition  the disturbance in which the bracton
windows had been broken was taken little notice of in the london papers
or even in the  edgestow telegraph   but it was followed by other
episodes  there was an indecent assault in one of the mean streets down
by the station  there were two “beatings up” in a public-house  there
were increasing complaints of threatening and disorderly behaviour on
the part of the n i c e  workmen  but these complaints never appeared in
the papers  those who had actually seen ugly incidents were surprised to
read in the  telegraph  that the new institute was settling down very
comfortably in edgestow and the most cordial relations developing
between it and the natives  those who had not seen them but only heard
of them  finding nothing in the  telegraph   dismissed the stories as
rumours or exaggerations  those who had seen them wrote letters to it 
but it did not print their letters 

but if episodes could be doubted  no one could doubt that nearly all the
hotels of the town had passed into the hands of the institute  so that a
man could no longer drink with a friend in his accustomed bar  that
familiar shops were crowded with strangers who seemed to have plenty of
money  and that prices were higher  that there was a queue for every
omnibus and a difficulty in getting into every cinema  quiet houses that
had looked out on quiet streets were shaken all day long by heavy and
unaccustomed traffic  wherever one went one was jostled by crowds of
strangers  to a little midland market town like edgestow even visitors
from the other side of the county had hitherto ranked as aliens  the
day-long clamour of northern  welsh  and even irish voices  the shouts 
the cat-calls  the songs  the wild faces passing in the fog  were
utterly detestable  “theres going to be trouble here” was the comment
of many a citizen  and in a few days  “youd think they  wanted 
trouble ” it is not recorded who first said  “we need more police ” and
then at last the  edgestow telegraph  took notice  a shy little
article—a cloud no bigger than a mans hand—appeared suggesting that the
local police were quite incapable of dealing with the new population 

of all these things jane took little notice  she was  during these days 
merely “hanging on ” perhaps mark would summon her to belbury  perhaps
he would give up the whole belbury scheme and come home—his letters were
vague and unsatisfactory  perhaps she would go out to st  annes and see
the dennistons  the dreams continued  but mr  denniston had been right 
it was better when one had given in to regarding them as “news ” if it
had not been she could hardly have endured her nights  there was one
recurrent dream in which nothing exactly happened  she seemed indeed to
be lying in her own bed  but there was someone beside the bed—someone
who had apparently drawn a chair up to the bedside and then sat down to
watch  he had a note-book in which he occasionally made an entry 
otherwise he sat perfectly still and patiently attentive—like a doctor 
she knew his face already  and came to know it infinitely well  the
pince-nez  the well-chiselled  rather white features  and the little
pointed beard  and presumably—if he could see her—he must by now know
hers equally well  it was certainly herself whom he appeared to be
studying  jane did not write about this to the dennistons the first time
it occurred  even after the second she delayed until it was too late to
post the letter that day  she had a sort of hope that the longer she
kept silent the more likely they would be to come in and see her again 
she wanted comfort  but she wanted it  if possible  without going out to
st  annes  without meeting this fisher-king man and getting drawn into
his orbit 

mark meanwhile was working at the rehabilitation of alcasan  he had
never seen a police dossier before and found it difficult to understand 
in spite of his efforts to conceal his ignorance the fairy soon
discovered it  “ill put you onto the captain ” she said  “hell show
you the ropes ” that was how mark came to spend most of his working
hours with her second in command  captain ohara  a big white-haired man
with a handsome face  talking in what english people called a southern
brogue and irish people “a dublin accent you could cut with a knife ” he
claimed to be of ancient family and had a seat at castlemortle  mark did
not really understand his explanations of the dossier  the q register 
the sliding file system  and what the captain called “weeding ” but he
was ashamed to confess this and so it came about that the whole
selection of facts really remained in oharas hands and mark found
himself working merely as a writer  he did his best to conceal this from
ohara and to make it appear that they were really working together 
this naturally made it impossible for him to repeat his original
protests against being treated as a mere journalist  he had  indeed  a
taking style  which had helped his academic career much more than he
would have liked to acknowledge  and his journalism was a success  his
articles and letters about alcasan appeared in papers where he would
never have had the  entrée  over his own signature  papers read by
millions  he could not help feeling a little thrill of pleasurable
excitement 

he also confided to captain ohara his minor financial anxieties  when
was one paid  and in the meantime he was short of petty cash  he had
lost his wallet on his very first night at belbury and it had never been
recovered  ohara roared with laughter  “sure you can have any money you
like by asking the steward ”

“you mean its then deducted from ones next cheque ” asked mark 

“man ” said the captain  “once youre in the institute  god bless it 
you neednt bother your head about that  arent we going to take over
the whole currency question  its we that  make  money ”

“do you mean ” gasped mark and then paused and added  “but theyd come
down on you for the lot if you left ”

“what do you want to be talking about leaving for at all ” said ohara 
“no one leaves the institute  at least the only one that ever i heard of
was old hingest ”

about this time  hingests inquest came to an end with a verdict of
murder by a person or persons unknown  the funeral service was held in
the college chapel at bracton 

it was the third and thickest day of the fog  which was now so dense and
white that mens eyes smarted from looking at it and all distant sounds
were annihilated  only the drip from eaves and trees and the shouts of
the workmen outside the chapel were audible within the college  inside
the chapel the candles burned with straight flames  each flame the
centre of a globe of greasy luminosity  and cast almost no light on the
building as a whole  but for the coughing and shuffling of feet one
would not have known that the stalls were quite full  curry 
black-suited and black-gowned and looming unnaturally large  went to and
fro at the western end of the chapel  whispering and peering  anxious
lest the fog might delay the arrival of what he called the remains  and
not unpleasingly conscious of the weight wherewith his responsibility
for the whole ceremony pressed upon his shoulders  curry was very great
at college funerals  there was no taint of the undertaker about him  he
was the restrained  manly friend  stricken by a heavy blow but still
mindful that he was  in some undefined sense  the father of the college
and that amid all the spoils of mutability he  at any rate  must not
give way  strangers who had been present on such occasions often said to
one another as they drove off  “you could see that sub-warden chap felt
it  though he wasnt going to show it ” there was no hypocrisy in this 
curry was so used to superintending the lives of his colleagues that it
came naturally to him to superintend their deaths  and possibly  if he
had possessed an analytic mind  he might have discovered in himself a
vague feeling that his influence  his power of smoothing paths and
pulling suitable wires  could not really quite cease once the breath was
out of the body 

the organ began to play and drowned both the coughing within and the
harsher noises without—the monotonously ill-tempered voices  the rattle
of iron  and the vibrating shocks with which loads were flung from time
to time against the chapel wall  but the fog had  as curry feared 
delayed the coffin  and the organist had been playing for half an hour
before there came a stir about the door and the family mourners  the
black-clad hingests of both sexes with their ram-rod backs and county
faces  began to be ushered into the stalls reserved for them  then came
maces and beadles and censors and the grand rector of edgestow  then 
singing  the choir  and finally the coffin—an island of appalling
flowers drifting indistinctly through the fog  which seemed to have
poured in  thicker  colder  and wetter  with the opening of the door 
the service began 

canon storey took it  his voice was still beautiful  and there was
beauty  too  in his isolation from all that company  he was isolated
both by his faith and by his deafness  he felt no qualm about the
appropriateness of the words which he read over the corpse of the proud
old unbeliever  for he had never suspected his unbelief  and he was
wholly unconscious of the strange antiphony between his own voice
reading and the other voices from without  glossop might wince when one
of those voices  impossible to ignore in the silence of the chapel  was
heard shouting  “take your bucking great foot out of the light or ill
let you have the whole lot on top of it”  but storey  unmoved and
unaware  replied  “thou fool  that which thou sowest is not quickened
unless it die ”

“ill give you one across your ugly face in a moment  see if i dont ”
said the voice again 

“it is sown a natural body  it is raised a spiritual body ” said storey 

“disgraceful  disgraceful ” muttered curry to the bursar who sat next to
him  but some of the junior fellows saw  as they said  the funny side of
it and thought how feverstone  who had been unable to be present  would
enjoy the story 


                                  iii

the pleasantest of the rewards which fell to mark for his obedience was
admission to the library  shortly after his brief intrusion into it on
that miserable morning he had discovered that this room  though
nominally public  was in practice reserved for what one had learned  at
school  to call “bloods” and  at bracton  “the progressive element ” it
was on the library hearthrug and during the hours between ten and
midnight that the important and confidential talks took place  and that
was why  when feverstone one evening sidled up to mark in the lounge and
said  “what about a drink in the library ” mark smiled and agreed and
harboured no resentment for the last conversation he had had with
feverstone  if he felt a little contempt of himself for doing so  he
repressed and forgot it  that sort of thing was childish and
unrealistic 

the circle in the library usually consisted of feverstone  the fairy 
filostrato  and—more surprising—straik  it was balm to marks wounds to
find that steele never appeared there  he had apparently got in beyond 
or behind  steele  as they had promised him he would  all was working
according to programme  one person whose frequent appearance in the
library he did not understand was the silent man with the pince-nez and
the pointed beard  professor frost  the deputy director—or  as mark now
called him  the d d  or old man—was often there  but in a peculiar mode 
he had a habit of drifting in and sauntering about the room  creaking
and humming as usual  sometimes he came up to the circle by the fire and
listened and looked on with a vaguely parental expression on his face 
but he seldom said anything and he never joined the party  he drifted
away again  and then  perhaps  would return about an hour later and once
more potter about the empty parts of the room and once more go away  he
had never spoken to mark since the humiliating interview in his study 
and mark learned from the fairy that he was still out of favour  “the
old man will thaw in time ” she said  “but i told you he didnt like
people to talk about leaving ”

the least satisfactory member of the circle in marks eyes was straik 
straik made no effort to adapt himself to the ribald and realistic tone
in which his colleagues spoke  he never drank nor smoked  he would sit
silent  nursing a threadbare knee with a lean hand and turning his large
unhappy eyes from one speaker to another  without attempting to combat
them or to join in the joke when they laughed  then—perhaps once in the
whole evening—something said would start him off  usually something
about the opposition of reactionaries in the outer world and the
measures which the n i c e  would take to deal with it  at such moments
he would burst into loud and prolonged speech  threatening  denouncing 
prophesying  the strange thing was that the others neither interrupted
him nor laughed  there was some deeper unity between this uncouth man
and them which apparently held in check the obvious lack of sympathy 
but what it was mark did not discover  sometimes straik addressed him in
particular  talking  to marks great discomfort and bewilderment  about
resurrection  “neither a historical fact nor a fable  young man ” he
said  “but a prophecy  all the miracles       shadows of things to come 
get rid of false spirituality  it is all going to happen  here in this
world  in the only world there is  what did the master tell us  heal the
sick  cast out devils  raise the dead  we shall  the son of man—that is 
man himself  full grown—has power to judge the world—to distribute life
without end  and punishment without end  you shall see  here and now ”
it was all very unpleasant 

it was on the day after hingests funeral that mark first ventured to
walk into the library on his own  hitherto he had always been supported
by feverstone or filostrato  he was a little uncertain of his reception 
and yet also afraid that if he did not soon assert his right to the
 entrée  this modesty might damage him  he knew that in such matters the
error in either direction is equally fatal  one has to guess and take
the risk 

it was a brilliant success  the circle were all there and before he had
closed the door behind him all had turned with welcoming faces and
filostrato had said “ ecco ” and the fairy  “heres the very man ” a
glow of sheer pleasure passed over marks whole body  never had the fire
seemed to burn more brightly nor the smell of the drinks to be more
attractive  he was actually being waited for  he was wanted 

“how quick can you write two leading articles  mark ” said feverstone 

“can you work all night ” asked miss hardcastle 

“i  have  done ” said mark  “whats it all about ”

“you are satisfied ” asked filostrato  “that it—the disturbance—must go
forward at once  yes ”

“thats the joke of it ” said feverstone  “shes done her work too well 
she hasnt read her ovid   ad metam properate simul  ”

“we cannot delay it if we wished ” said straik 

“what are we talking about ” said mark 

“the disturbances at edgestow ” answered feverstone 

“oh        i havent been following them very much  are they becoming
serious ”

“theyre going to become serious  sonny ” said the fairy  “and thats
the point  the real riot was timed for next week  all this little stuff
was only meant to prepare the ground  but its been going on too well 
damn it  the balloon will have to go up to-morrow  or the day after at
latest ”

mark glanced in bewilderment from her face to feverstones  the latter
doubled himself up with laughter and mark  almost automatically  gave a
jocular turn to his own bewilderment 

“i think the penny hasnt dropped  fairy ” he said 

“you surely didnt imagine ” grinned feverstone  “that the fairy left
the initiative with the natives ”

“you mean she herself is the disturbance ” said mark 

“yes  yes ” said filostrato  his little eyes glistening above his fat
cheeks 

“its all fair and square ” said miss hardcastle  “you cant put a few
hundred thousand imported workmen——”

“not the sort you enrolled ” interjected feverstone 

“into a sleepy little hole like edgestow ” miss hardcastle continued 
“without having trouble  i mean thered have been trouble anyway  as it
turns out  i dont believe my boys needed to do anything  but  since the
trouble was bound to come  there was no harm in seeing it came at the
right moment ”

“you mean youve  engineered  the disturbances ” said mark  to do him
justice  his mind was reeling from this new revelation  nor was he aware
of any decision to conceal his state of mind  in the snugness and
intimacy of that circle he found his facial muscles and his voice 
without any conscious volition  taking on the tone of his colleagues 

“thats a crude way of putting it ” said feverstone 

“it makes no difference ” said filostrato  “this is how things have to
be managed ”

“quite ” said miss hardcastle  “its always done  anyone who knows
police work will tell you  and as i say  the real thing—the big
riot—must take place within the next forty-eight hours ”

“its nice to get the tip straight from the horses mouth ” said mark 
“i wish id got my wife out of the town  though ”

“where does she live ” said the fairy 

“up at sandown ”

“ah  itll hardly affect her  in the meantime  you and i have got to get
busy about the account of the riot ”

“but—whats it all for ”

“emergency regulations ” said feverstone  “youll never get the powers
we want at edgestow until the government declares that a state of
emergency exists there ”

“exactly ” said filostrato  “it is folly to talk of peaceful
revolutions  not that the  canaglia  would always resist—often they have
to be prodded into it—but until there is the disturbance  the firing 
the barricades—no one gets powers to act effectively  there is not
enough what you call weigh on the boat to steer him ”

“and the stuff must be all ready to appear in the papers the very day
after the riot ” said miss hardcastle  “that means it must be handed in
to the d d  by six to-morrow morning at latest ”

“but how are we to write it to-night if the thing doesnt even happen
till to-morrow at the earliest ”

everyone burst out laughing 

“youll never manage publicity that way  mark ” said feverstone  “you
surely dont need to wait for a thing to happen before you tell the
story of it ”

“well  i admit ” said mark  and his face also was full of laughter  “i
had a faint prejudice for doing so  not living in mr  dunnes sort of
time nor in looking-glass land ”

“no good  sonny ” said miss hardcastle  “weve got to get on with it at
once  time for one more drink and you and id better go upstairs and
begin  well get them to give us devilled bones and coffee at two ”

this was the first thing mark had been asked to do which he himself 
before he did it  clearly knew to be criminal  but the moment of his
consent almost escaped his notice  certainly  there was no struggle  no
sense of turning a corner  there may have been a time in the worlds
history when such moments fully revealed their gravity  with witches
prophesying on a blasted heath or visible rubicons to be crossed  but 
for him  it all slipped past in a chatter of laughter  of that intimate
laughter between fellow professionals  which of all earthly powers is
strongest to make men do very bad things before they are yet 
individually  very bad men  a few moments later he was trotting upstairs
with the fairy  they passed cosser on the way and mark  talking busily
to his companion  saw out of the corner of his eye that cosser was
watching them  to think that he had once been afraid of cosser 

“who has the job of waking the d d  up at six ” asked mark 

“probably not necessary ” said the fairy  “i suppose the old man must
sleep sometime  but ive never discovered when he does it ”


                                   iv

at four oclock mark sat in the fairys office re-reading the last two
articles he had written—one for the most respectable of our papers  the
other for a more popular organ  this was the only part of the nights
work which had anything in it to flatter literary vanity  the earlier
hours had been spent in the sterner labour of concocting the news
itself  these two leaders had been kept for the end  and the ink was
still wet  the first was as follows 

  “while it would be premature to make any final comment on last nights
  riot at edgestow  two conclusions seem to emerge from the first
  accounts  which we publish elsewhere  with a clarity which is not
  likely to be shaken by subsequent developments  in the first place 
  the whole episode will administer a rude shock to any complacency
  which may still lurk among us as to the enlightenment of our own
  civilisation  it must  of course  be admitted that the transformation
  of a small university town into a centre of national research cannot
  be carried out without some friction and some cases of hardship to the
  local inhabitants  but the englishman has always had his own quiet and
  humorous way of dealing with frictions and has never showed himself
  unwilling  when the issue is properly put before him  to make
  sacrifices much greater than those small alterations of habit and
  sentiment which progress demands of the people of edgestow  it is
  gratifying to note that there is no suggestion in any authoritative
  quarter that the n i c e  has in any way exceeded its powers or failed
  in that consideration and courtesy which was expected of it  and there
  is little doubt that the actual starting-point of the disturbances was
  some quarrel  probably in a public-house  between one of the n i c e 
  workmen and some local sir oracle  but as the stagyrite said long ago 
  disorders which have trivial occasions have deeper causes  and there
  seems little doubt that this petty  fracas  must have been inflamed 
  if not exploited  by sectional interests or widespread prejudice 

  “it is disquieting to be forced to suspect that the old distrust of
  planned efficiency and the old jealousy of what is ambiguously called
  bureaucracy can be so easily  though  we hope  temporarily  revived 
  though at the same time  this very suspicion  by revealing the gaps
  and weaknesses in our national level of education  emphasises one of
  the very diseases which the national institute exists to cure  that it
  will cure it we need have no doubt  the will of the nation is behind
  this magnificent peace-effort  as mr  jules so happily described the
  institute  and any ill-informed opposition which ventures to try
  conclusions with it will be  we hope gently  but certainly firmly 
  resisted 

  “the second moral to be drawn from last nights events is a more
  cheering one  the original proposal to provide the n i c e  with what
  is misleadingly called its own police force was viewed with distrust
  in many quarters  our readers will remember that while not sharing
  that distrust  we extended to it a certain sympathy  even the false
  fears of those who love liberty should be respected as we respect even
  the ill-grounded anxieties of a mother  at the same time we insisted
  that the complexity of modern society rendered it an anachronism to
  confine the actual execution of the will of society to a body of men
  whose real function was the prevention and detection of crime  that
  the police  in fact  must be relieved sooner or later of that growing
  body of coercive functions which do not properly fall within their
  sphere  that this problem has been solved by other countries in a
  manner which proved fatal to liberty and justice  by creating a real
   imperium in imperio   is a fact which no one is likely to forget  the
  so-called police of the n i c e —who should rather be called its
  sanitary executive—is the characteristically english solution  its
  relation to the national police cannot  perhaps  be defined with
  perfect logical accuracy  but  as a nation  we have never been much
  enamoured of logic  the executive of the n i c e  has no connection
  with politics  and if it ever comes into relation with criminal
  justice  it does so in the gracious role of a rescuer—a rescuer who
  can remove the criminal from the harsh sphere of punishment into that
  of remedial treatment  if any doubt as to the value of such a force
  existed  it has been amply set at rest by the episodes at edgestow 
  the happiest relations seem to have been maintained throughout between
  the officers of the institute and the national police  who  but for
  the assistance of the institute  would have found themselves faced
  with an impossible situation  as an eminent police officer observed to
  one of our representatives this morning  but for the n i c e  police 
  things would have taken quite a different turn  if in the light of
  these events it is found convenient to place the whole edgestow area
  under the exclusive control of the institutional police for some
  limited period  we do not believe that the british people—always
  realists at heart—will have the slightest objection  a special tribute
  is due to the female members of the force  who appear to have acted
  throughout with that mixture of courage and common sense which the
  last few years have taught us to expect of englishwomen almost as a
  matter of course  the wild rumours  current in london this morning  of
  machine-gun fire in the streets and casualties by the hundred  remain
  to be sifted  probably  when accurate details are available  it will
  be found  in the words of a recent prime minister  that when blood
  flowed  it was generally from the nose ”

the second ran thus 

  “what is happening at edgestow 

  “that is the question which john citizen wants to have answered  the
  institute which has settled at edgestow is a  national  institute 
  that means it is yours and mine  we are not scientists and we do not
  pretend to know what the master-brains of the institute are thinking 
  we do know what each man or woman expects of it  we expect a solution
  of the unemployment problem  the cancer problem  the housing problem 
  the problems of currency  of war  of education  we expect from it a
  brighter  cleaner  and fuller life for our children in which we and
  they can march ever onward and onward and develop to the full the urge
  of life which god has given each one of us  the n i c e  is the
  peoples instrument for bringing about all the things we fought for 

  “meanwhile—what is happening at edgestow 

  “do you believe this riot arose simply because mrs  snooks or mr 
  buggins found that the landlords had sold their shop or their
  allotment to the n i c e   mrs  snooks and mr  buggins know better 
  they know that the institute means more trade in edgestow  more public
  amenities  a larger population  a burst of undreamed-of prosperity  i
  say these disturbances have been engineered 

  “therefore i ask yet again  what is happening at edgestow 

  “there are traitors in the camp  i am not afraid to say so  whoever
  they may be  they may be so-called religious people  they may be
  financial interests  they may be the old cobweb-spinning professors
  and philosophers of edgestow university itself  they may be jews  they
  may be lawyers  i dont care who they are  but i have one thing to
  tell them  take care  the people of england are not going to stand
  this  we are not going to have the institute sabotaged 

  “what is to be done at edgestow 

  “i say  put the whole place under the institutional police  some of
  you may have been to edgestow for a holiday  if so  youll know as
  well as i do what it is like—a little  sleepy  country town with half
  a dozen policemen who have had nothing to do for ten years but stop
  cyclists because their lamps had gone out  it doesnt make sense to
  expect these poor old bobbies to deal with an engineered riot  last
  night the n i c e  police showed that they could  what i say is—hats
  off to miss hardcastle and her brave boys  yes  and her brave girls
  too  give them a free hand and let them get on with the job  cut out
  the red tape 

  “ive one bit of advice  if you hear anyone backbiting the n i c e 
  police  tell him where he gets off  if you hear anyone comparing them
  to the gestapo or the ogpu  tell him youve heard that one before  if
  you hear anyone talking about the liberties of england  by which he
  means the liberties of the obscurantists  the mrs  grundies  the
  bishops  and the capitalists  watch that man  hes the enemy  tell him
  from me that the n i c e  is the boxing-glove on the democracys fist 
  and if he doesnt like it hed best get out of the way 

  “meanwhile—watch edgestow ”

it might be supposed that after enjoying these articles in the heat of
composition  mark would awake to reason  and with it to disgust  when
reading through the finished product  unfortunately the process had been
almost the reverse  he had become more and more reconciled to the job
the longer he worked at it 

the complete reconciliation came when he fair-copied both articles  when
a man has crossed the ts and dotted the is  and likes the look of his
work  he does not wish it to be committed to the waste-paper basket  the
more often he re-read the articles the better he liked them  and anyway 
the thing was a kind of joke  he had in his mind a picture of himself 
old and rich  probably with a peerage  certainly very distinguished 
when all this—all the unpleasant side of the n i c e —was over  regaling
his juniors with wild  unbelievable tales of this present time   “ah
      it was a rum show in those early days  i remember once      ”  and
then  too  for a man whose writings had hitherto appeared only in
learned periodicals or at best in books which only other dons would
read  there was an all but irresistible lure in the thought of the daily
press—editors waiting for copy—readers all over europe—something really
depending on his words  the idea of the immense dynamo which had been
placed for the moment at his disposal  thrilled through his whole being 
it was  after all  not so long ago that he had been excited by admission
to the progressive element at bracton  but what was the progressive
element to this  it wasnt as if he were taken in by the articles
himself  he was writing with his tongue in his cheek—a phrase that
somehow comforted him by making the whole thing appear like a practical
joke  and anyway  if he didnt do it  someone else would  and all the
while the child inside him whispered how splendid and how triumphantly
grown up it was to be sitting like this  so full of alcohol and yet not
drunk  writing  with his tongue in his cheek  articles for great
newspapers  against time  “with the printers devil at the door” and all
the inner ring of the n i c e  depending on him  and nobody ever again
having the least right to consider him a nonentity or cipher

jane stretched out her hand in the darkness but did not feel the table
which ought to have been there at her beds head  then with a shock of
surprise she discovered that she was not in bed at all  but standing 
there was utter darkness all about her and it was intensely cold 
groping  she touched what appeared to be uneven surfaces of stone  the
air  also  had some odd quality about it—dead air  imprisoned air  it
seemed  somewhere far away  possibly overhead  there were noises which
came to her muffled and shuddering as if through earth  so the worst had
happened       a bomb had fallen on the house and she was buried alive 
but before she had time to feel the full impact of this idea she
remembered that the war was over       oh  and all sorts of things had
happened since then       she had married mark       she had seen
alcasan in his cell       she had met camilla  then  with great and
swift relief she thought  “it is one of my dreams  it is a piece of
news  itll stop presently  theres nothing to be frightened of ”

the place  whatever it was  did not seem to be very large  she groped
all along one of the rough walls and then  turning at the corner  struck
her foot against something hard  she stooped down and felt  there was a
sort of raised platform or table of stone  about three feet high  and on
it  did she dare to explore  but it would be worse not to  she began
trying the surface of the stone table with her hand  and next moment bit
her lip to save herself from screaming  for she had touched a human
foot  it was a naked foot  and dead to judge by its coldness  to go on
groping seemed the hardest thing she had ever done  but somehow she was
impelled to do it  the corpse was clothed in some very coarse stuff
which was also uneven  as though it were heavily embroidered  and very
voluminous  it must be a very large man  she thought  still groping
upwards towards his head  on his chest the texture suddenly changed—as
if the skin of some hairy animal had been laid over the coarse robe  so
she thought at first  then she realised that the hair really belonged to
a beard  she hesitated about feeling the face  she had a fear lest the
man should stir or wake or speak if she did so  she therefore became
still for a moment  it was only a dream  she could bear it  but it was
so dreary and it all seemed to be happening so long ago  as if she had
slipped through a cleft in the present  down into some cold  sunless pit
of the remote past  she hoped they wouldnt leave her here long  if only
someone would come quickly and let her out  and immediately she had a
picture of someone  someone bearded but also  it was odd  divinely
young  someone all golden and strong and warm coming with a mighty
earth-shaking tread down into that black place  the dream became chaotic
at this point  jane had an impression that she ought to curtsey to this
person  who never actually arrived though the impression of him lay
bright and heavy on her mind  and felt great consternation on realising
that some dim memories of dancing lessons at school were not sufficient
to show her how to do so  at this point she woke 

she went into edgestow immediately after breakfast to hunt  as she now
hunted every day  for someone who would replace mrs  maggs  at the top
of market street something happened which finally determined her to go
to st  annes that very day and by the 10 23 train  she came to a place
where a big car was standing beside the pavement  an n i c e  car  just
as she reached it a man came out of a shop  cut across her path to speak
to the chauffeur of the car  and then got in  he was so close to her
that  despite the fog  she saw him very clearly  in isolation from all
other objects  the background was all grey fog and passing feet and the
harsh sounds of that unaccustomed traffic which now never ceased in
edgestow  she would have known him  anywhere  not marks face  not her
own face in a mirror  was by now more familiar  she saw the pointed
beard  the pince-nez  the face which somehow reminded her of a waxworks
face  she had no need to think what she would do  her body  walking
quickly past  seemed of itself to have decided that it was heading for
the station and thence for st  annes  it was something different from
fear  though she was frightened  too  almost to the point of nausea 
that drove her so unerringly forward  it was a total rejection of  or
revulsion from  this man on all levels of her being at once  dreams sank
into insignificance compared with the blinding reality of the mans
presence  she shuddered to think that their hands might have touched as
she passed him 

the train was blessedly warm  her compartment empty  the fact of sitting
down delightful  the slow journey through the fog almost sent her to
sleep  she hardly thought about st  annes until she found herself
there  even as she walked up the steep hill she made no plans  rehearsed
nothing that she meant to say  but only thought of camilla and mrs 
dimble  the childish levels  the undersoil of the mind  had been turned
up  she wanted to be with nice people  away from nasty people—that
nursery distinction seeming at the moment more important than any later
categories of good and bad or friend and enemy 

she was roused from this state by noticing that it was lighter  she
looked ahead  surely that bend in the road was more visible than it
ought to be in such a fog  or was it only that a country fog was
different from a town one  certainly what had been grey was becoming
white  almost dazzlingly white  a few yards farther and luminous blue
was showing overhead  and trees cast shadows  she had not seen a shadow
for days   and then all of a sudden the enormous spaces of the sky had
become visible and the pale golden sun  and looking back  as she took
the turn to the manor  jane saw that she was standing on the shore of a
little green sunlit island looking down on a sea of white fog  furrowed
and ridged yet level on the whole  which spread as far as she could see 
there were other islands too  that dark one to the west was the wooded
hills above sandown where she had picnicked with the dennistons  and the
far bigger and brighter one to the north was the many-caverned
hills—mountains one could nearly call them—in which the wynd had its
source  she took a deep breath  it was the  size  of this world above
the fog which impressed her  down in edgestow all these days one had
lived  even when out of doors  as if in a room  for only objects close
at hand were visible  she felt she had come near to forgetting how big
the sky is  how remote the horizon 




                                 seven
                             the pendragon 


                                   i

before she reached the door in the wall jane met mr  denniston and he
guided her into the manor  not by that door but by the main gate which
opened on the same road a few hundred yards farther on  she told him her
story as they walked  in his company she had that curious sensation
which most married people know of being with someone whom  for the final
but wholly mysterious reason  one could never have married but who is
nevertheless more of ones own world than the person one has married in
fact  as they entered the house they met mrs  maggs 

“what  mrs  studdock  fancy ” said mrs  maggs 

“yes  ivy ” said denniston  “and bringing great news  things are
beginning to move  we must see grace at once  and is macphee about ”

“hes out gardening hours ago ” said mrs  maggs  “and dr  dimbles gone
into college  and camillas in the kitchen  shall i send her along ”

“yes  do  and if you can prevent mr  bultitude from butting in——”

“thats right  ill keep him out of mischief all right  youd like a cup
of tea  mrs  studdock  wouldnt you  coming by train and all that ”

a few minutes later jane found herself once more in grace ironwoods
room  miss ironwood and the dennistons all sat facing her so that she
felt as if she were the candidate in a  viva voce  examination  and when
ivy maggs brought in the tea she did not go away again  but sat down as
if she also were one of the examiners 

“now ” said camilla  her eyes and nostrils widened with a sort of fresh
mental hunger—it was too concentrated to be called excitement 

jane glanced round the room 

“you need not mind ivy  young lady ” said miss ironwood  “she is one of
our company ”

there was a pause  “we have your letter of the 10th ” continued miss
ironwood  “describing your dream of the man with the pointed beard
sitting making notes in your bedroom  perhaps i ought to tell you that
he wasnt really there  at least  the director does not think it
possible  but he was really studying  you   he was getting information
about you from some other source which  unfortunately  was not visible
to you in the dream ”

“will you tell us  if you dont mind ” said mr  denniston  “what you
were telling me as we came along ”

jane told them about the dream of the corpse  if it was a corpse  in the
dark place and how she had met the bearded man that morning in market
street  and at once she was aware of having created intense interest 

“fancy ” said ivy maggs  “so we were right about bragdon wood ” said
camilla  “it  is  really belbury ” said her husband  “but in that case 
where does alcasan come in ”

“excuse me ” said miss ironwood in her level voice  and the others
became instantly silent  “we must not discuss the matter here  mrs 
studdock has not yet joined us ”

“am i to be told nothing ” asked jane 

“young lady ” said miss ironwood  “you must excuse me  it would not be
wise at the moment  indeed  we are not at liberty to do so  will you
allow me to ask you two more questions ”

“if you like ” said jane  a little sulkily but only a very little  the
presence of camilla and camillas husband somehow put her on her best
behaviour 

miss ironwood had opened a drawer and for a few moments there was
silence while she hunted in it  then she handed a photograph across to
jane and asked  “do you recognise that person ”

“yes ” said jane in a low voice  “that is the man i dreamed of and the
man i saw this morning in edgestow ”

it was a good photograph and beneath it was the name augustus frost 
with a few other details which jane did not at the moment take in 

“in the second place ” continued miss ironwood  holding out her hand for
jane to return the photograph  “are you prepared to see the director
       now  ”

“well—yes  if you like ”

“in that case  arthur ” said miss ironwood to denniston  “you had better
go and tell him what we have just heard and find out if he is well
enough to meet mrs  studdock ”

denniston at once rose 

“in the meantime ” said miss ironwood  “i would like a word with mrs 
studdock alone ” at this the others rose also and preceded denniston out
of the room  a very large cat which jane had not noticed before jumped
up and occupied the chair which ivy maggs had just vacated 

“i have very little doubt ” said miss ironwood  “that the director will
see you ”

jane said nothing 

“and at that interview ” continued the other  “you will  i presume  be
called upon to make a final decision ”

jane gave a little cough which had no other purpose than to dispel a
certain air of unwelcome solemnity which seemed to have settled on the
room as soon as she and miss ironwood were left alone 

“there are also certain things ” said miss ironwood  “which you ought to
know about the director before you see him  he will appear to you  mrs 
studdock  to be a very young man  younger than yourself  you will please
understand that this is not the case  he is nearer fifty than forty  he
is a man of very great experience  who has travelled where no other
human being ever travelled before and mixed in societies of which you
and i have no conception ”

“that is very interesting ” said jane  though displaying no interest 

“and thirdly ” said miss ironwood  “i must ask you to remember that he
is often in great pain  whatever decision you come to  i trust you will
not say or do anything that may put an unnecessary strain upon him ”

“if mr  fisher-king is not well enough to see visitors        ” said
jane vaguely 

“you must excuse me ” said miss ironwood  “for impressing these points
upon you  i am a doctor  and i am the only doctor in our company  i am
therefore responsible for protecting him as far as i can  if you will
now come with me i will show you to the blue room ”

she rose and held the door open for jane  they passed out into the
plain  narrow passage and thence up shallow steps into a large entrance
hall whence a fine georgian staircase led to the upper floors  the
house  larger than jane had at first supposed  was warm and very silent 
and after so many days spent in fog the autumn sunlight  falling on soft
carpets and on walls  seemed to her bright and golden  on the first
floor  but raised above it by six steps  they found a little square
place with white pillars where camilla  quiet and alert  sat waiting for
them  there was a door behind her 

“he will see her ” she said to miss ironwood  getting up 

“is he in much pain this morning ”

“it is not continuous  it is one of his good days ”

as miss ironwood raised her hand to knock on the door  jane thought to
herself  “be careful  dont get let in for anything  all these long
passages and low voices will make a fool of you if you dont look out 
youll become another of this mans female adorers ” next moment she
found herself going in  it was light—it seemed all windows  and it was
warm—a fire blazed on the hearth  and blue was the prevailing colour 
before her eyes had taken it in she was annoyed  and in a way ashamed 
to see that miss ironwood was curtseying  “i wont” contended in janes
mind with “i cant”  for it had been true in her dream  she couldnt 

“this is the young lady  sir ” said miss ironwood 

jane looked  and instantly her world was unmade 

on a sofa before her  with one foot bandaged as if he had a wound  lay
what appeared to be a boy  twenty years old 

on one of the long window-sills a tame jackdaw was walking up and down 
the light of the fire with its weak reflection  and the light of the sun
with its stronger reflection  contended on the ceiling  but all the
light in the room seemed to run towards the gold hair and the gold beard
of the wounded man 

of course he was not a boy—how could she have thought so  the fresh skin
on his forehead and cheeks and  above all  on his hands  had suggested
the idea  but no boy could have so full a beard  and no boy could be so
strong  she had expected to see an invalid  now  it was manifest that
the grip of those hands would be inescapable  and imagination suggested
that those arms and shoulders could support the whole house  miss
ironwood at her side struck her as a little old woman  shrivelled and
pale—a thing you could have blown away 

the sofa was placed on a kind of dais divided from the rest of the room
by a step  she had an impression of massed hangings of blue—later  she
saw that it was only a screen—behind the man  so that the effect was
that of a throne room  she would have called it silly if  instead of
seeing it  she had been told of it by another  through the window she
saw no trees nor hills nor shapes of other houses  only the level floor
of mist  as if this man and she were perched in a blue tower overlooking
the world 

pain came and went in his face  sudden jabs of sickening and burning
pain  but as lightning goes through the darkness and the darkness closes
up again and shows no trace  so the tranquillity of his countenance
swallowed up each shock of torture  how could she have thought him
young  or old either  it came over her  with a sensation of quick fear 
that this face was of no age at all  she had  or so she had believed 
disliked bearded faces except for old men with white hair  but that was
because she had long since forgotten the imagined arthur of her
childhood—and the imagined solomon too  solomon       for the first time
in many years the bright solar blend of king and lover and magician
which hangs about that name stole back upon her mind  for the first time
in all those years she tasted the word  king  itself with all its linked
associations of battle  marriage  priesthood  mercy  and power  at that
moment  as her eyes first rested on his face  jane forgot who she was 
and where  and her faint grudge against grace ironwood  and her more
obscure grudge against mark  and her childhood and her fathers house 
it was  of course  only for a flash  next moment she was once more the
ordinary social jane  flushed and confused to find that she had been
staring rudely  at least she hoped that rudeness would be the main
impression produced  at a total stranger  but her world was unmade  she
knew that  anything might happen now 

“thank you  grace ” the man was saying  “is this mrs  studdock ”

and the voice also seemed to be like sunlight and gold  like gold not
only as gold is beautiful but as it is heavy  like sunlight not only as
it falls gently on english walls in autumn but as it beats down on the
jungle or the desert to engender life or destroy it  and now it was
addressing her 

“you must forgive me for not getting up  mrs  studdock ” it said  “my
foot is hurt ”

and jane heard her own voice saying “yes  sir ” soft and chastened like
miss ironwoods voice  she had meant to say  “good morning  mr 
fisher-king ” in an easy tone that would have counteracted the absurdity
of her behaviour on first entering the room  but the other was what
actually came out of her mouth  shortly after this she found herself
seated before the director  she was shaken  she was even shaking  she
hoped intensely that she was not going to cry  or be unable to speak  or
do anything silly  for her world was unmade  anything might happen now 
if only the conversation were over so that she could get out of that
room without disgrace  and go away  not for good  but for a long time 

“do you wish me to remain  sir ” said miss ironwood 

“no  grace ” said the director  “i dont think you need stay  thank
you ”

“and now ” thought jane  “its coming—its coming—its coming now ” all
the most intolerable questions he might ask  all the most extravagant
things he might make her do  flashed through her mind in a fatuous
medley  for all power of resistance seemed to have been drained away
from her and she was left without protection 


                                   ii

for the first few minutes after grace ironwood had left them alone  jane
hardly took in what the director was saying  it was not that her
attention wandered  on the contrary  her attention was so fixed on him
that it defeated itself  every tone  every look  how could they have
supposed she would think him  young     every gesture  was printing
itself upon her memory  and it was not until she found that he had
ceased speaking and was apparently awaiting an answer that she realised
she had taken in so little of what he had been saying 

“i—i beg your pardon ” she said  wishing that she did not keep on
turning red like a schoolgirl 

“i was saying ” he answered  “that you have already done us the greatest
possible service  we knew that one of the most dangerous attacks ever
made upon the human race was coming very soon and in this island  we had
an idea that belbury might be connected with it  but we were not
certain  we certainly did not know that belbury was so important  that
is why your information is so valuable  but in another way  it presents
us with a difficulty  i mean a difficulty as far as you are concerned 
we had hoped you would be able to join us—to become one of our army ”

“can i not  sir ” said jane 

“it is difficult ” said the director after a pause  “you see  your
husband is in belbury ”

jane glanced up  it had been on the tip of her tongue to say “do you
mean that mark is in any danger ” but she had realised that anxiety
about mark did not  in fact  make any part of the complex emotions she
was feeling  and that to reply thus would be hypocrisy  it was a sort of
scruple she had not often felt before  finally she said  “what do you
mean ”

“why ” said the director  “it would be hard for the same person to be
the wife of an official in the n i c e  and also a member of my
company ”

“you mean you couldnt trust me ”

“i mean nothing we need be afraid to speak of  i mean that  in the
circumstances  you and i and your husband could not all be trusting one
another ”

jane bit her lip in anger  not at the director but at mark  why should
he and his affairs with the feverstone man intrude themselves at such a
moment as this 

“i must do what i think right  mustnt i ” she said softly  “i mean—if
mark—if my husband—is on the wrong side  i cant let that make any
difference to what  i  do  can i ”

“you are thinking about what is  right  ” said the director  jane
started  and flushed  she had not  she realised  been thinking about
that 

“of course ” said the director  “things might come to such a point that
you would be justified in coming here  even wholly against his will 
even secretly  it depends on how close the danger is—the danger to us
all  and to you personally ”

“i thought the danger was right on top of us now       from the way mrs 
denniston talked ”

“that is just the question ” said the director  with a smile  “i am not
allowed to be  too  prudent  i am not allowed to use desperate remedies
until desperate diseases are really apparent  otherwise we become just
like our enemies—breaking all the rules whenever we imagine that it
might possibly do some vague good to humanity in the remote future ”

“but will it do anyone any harm if i come here ” asked jane 

he did not directly answer this  presently he spoke again 

“it looks as if you will have to go back  at least for the present  you
will  no doubt  be seeing your husband again fairly soon  i think you
must make at least one effort to detach him from the n i c e ”

“but how can i  sir ” said jane  “what have i to say to him  hed think
it all nonsense  he wouldnt believe all that about an attack on the
human race ” as soon as she had said it she wondered  “did that sound
cunning ” then  more disconcertingly  “ was  it cunning ”

“no ” said the director  “and you must not tell him  you must not
mention me nor the company at all  we have put our lives in your hands 
you must simply ask him to leave belbury  you must put it on your own
wishes  you are his wife ”

“mark never takes any notice of what i say ” answered jane  she and mark
each thought that of the other 

“perhaps ” said the director  “you have never asked anything as you will
be able to ask this  do you not  want  to save him as well as yourself ”

jane ignored this question  now that the threat of expulsion from the
house was imminent  she felt a kind of desperation  heedless of that
inner commentator who had more than once during this conversation shown
her her own words and wishes in such a novel light  she began speaking
rapidly 

“dont send me back ” she said  “i am all alone at home  with terrible
dreams  it isnt as if mark and i saw much of one another at the best of
times  i am so unhappy  he wont care whether i come here or not  hed
only laugh at it all if he knew  is it fair that my whole life should be
spoiled just because hes got mixed up with some horrible people  you
dont think a woman is to have no life of her own just because shes
married ”

“are you unhappy  now  ” said the director  a dozen affirmatives died on
janes lips as she looked up in answer to his question  then suddenly 
in a kind of deep calm  like the stillness at the centre of a whirlpool 
she saw the truth  and ceased at last to think how her words might make
him think of her  and answered  “no ”

“but ” she added after a short pause  “it will be worse now  if i go
back ”

“will it ”

“i dont know  no  i suppose not ” and for a little time jane was hardly
conscious of anything but peace and well-being  the comfort of her own
body in the chair where she sat  and a sort of clear beauty in the
colours and proportions of the room  but soon she began thinking to
herself  “this is the end  in a moment he will send for the ironwood
woman to take you away ” it seemed to her that her fate depended on what
she said in the next minute 

“but is it really necessary ” she began  “i dont think i look on
marriage quite as you do  it seems to me extraordinary that everything
should hang on what mark says       about something he doesnt
understand ”

“child ” said the director  “it is not a question of how you or i look
on marriage but how my masters look on it ”

“someone said they were very old fashioned  but——”

“that was a joke  they are not old fashioned  but they are very very
old ”

“they would never think of finding out first whether mark and i believed
in their ideas of marriage ”

“well—no ” said the director with a curious smile  “no  quite definitely
they wouldnt think of doing that ”

“and would it make no difference to them what a marriage was actually
like       whether it was a success  whether the woman loved her
husband ”

jane had not exactly intended to say this  much less to say it in the
cheaply pathetic tone which  it now seemed to her  she had used  hating
herself  and fearing the directors silence  she added  “but i suppose
you will say i oughtnt to have told you that ”

“my dear child ” said the director  “you have been telling me that ever
since your husband was mentioned ”

“does it make no difference ”

“i suppose ” said the director  “it would depend on how he lost your
love ”

jane was silent  though she could not tell the director the truth  and
indeed did not know it herself  yet when she tried to explore her
inarticulate grievance against mark  a novel sense of her own injustice
and even of pity for her husband  arose in her mind  and her heart sank 
for now it seemed to her that this conversation  to which she had
vaguely looked for some sort of deliverance from all problems  was in
fact involving her in new ones 

“it was not his fault ” she said at last  “i suppose our marriage was
just a mistake ”

the director said nothing 

“what would you—what would the people you are talking of—say about a
case like that ”

“i will tell you if you really want to know ” said the director 

“please ” said jane reluctantly 

“they would say ” he answered  “that you do not fail in obedience
through lack of love  but have lost love because you never attempted
obedience ”

something in jane that would normally have reacted to such a remark with
anger or laughter was banished to a remote distance  where she could
still  but only just  hear its voice  by the fact that the word
obedience—but certainly not obedience to mark—came over her  in that
room and in that presence  like a strange oriental perfume  perilous 
seductive  and ambiguous       

“stop it ” said the director sharply 

jane stared at him  open-mouthed  there were a few moments of silence
during which the exotic fragrance faded away 

“you were saying  my dear ” resumed the director 

“i thought love meant equality ” she said  “and free companionship ”

“ah  equality ” said the director  “we must talk of that some other
time  yes  we must all be guarded by equal rights from one anothers
greed  because we are fallen  just as we must all wear clothes for the
same reason  but the naked body should be there underneath the clothes 
ripening for the day when we shall need them no longer  equality is not
the deepest thing  you know ”

“i always thought that was just what it was  i thought it was in their
souls that people were equal ”

“you were mistaken ” said he gravely  “that is the last place where they
are equal  equality before the law  equality of incomes—that is very
well  equality guards life  it doesnt make it  it is medicine  not
food  you might as well try to warm yourself with a blue-book ”

“but surely in marriage        ”

“worse and worse ” said the director  “courtship knows nothing of it 
nor does fruition  what has free companionship to do with that  those
who are enjoying something  or suffering something together  are
companions  those who enjoy or suffer one another  are not  do you not
know how bashful friendship is  friends       comrades       do not look
 at  each other  friendship would be ashamed       ”

“i thought ” said jane and then stopped 

“i see ” said the director  “it is not your fault  they never warned
you  no one has ever told you that obedience—humility—is an erotic
necessity  you are putting equality just where it ought not to be  as to
your coming here  that may admit of some doubt  for the present  i must
send you back  you can come out and see us  in the meantime  talk to
your husband and i will talk to my authorities ”

“when will you be seeing them ”

“they come to me when they please  but weve been talking too solemnly
about obedience all this time  id like to show you some of its
drolleries  you are not afraid of mice are you ”

“afraid of what ” said jane in astonishment 

“mice ” said the director 

“no ” said jane in a puzzled voice 

the director struck a little bell beside his sofa which was almost
immediately answered by mrs  maggs 

“i think ” said the director  “i should like my lunch now  if you
please  they will give you lunch downstairs  mrs  studdock—something
more substantial than mine  but if you will sit with me while i eat and
drink  i will show you some of the amenities of our house ”

mrs  maggs presently returned with a tray  bearing a glass  a small
flagon of red wine  and a roll of bread  she set it down on a table at
the directors side and left the room 

“you see ” said the director  “i live like the king in  curdie   it is a
surprisingly pleasant diet ” with these words he broke the bread and
poured himself out a glass of wine 

“i never read the book you are speaking of ” said jane 

they talked of the book a little while the director ate and drank  but
presently he took up the plate and tipped the crumbs off on to the
floor  “now  mrs  studdock ” he said  “you shall see a diversion  but
you must be perfectly still ” with these words he took from his pocket a
little silver whistle and blew a note on it  and jane sat still till the
room became filled with silence like a solid thing and there was first a
scratching and then a rustling and presently she saw three plump mice
working their passage across what was to them the thick undergrowth of
the carpet  nosing this way and that so that if their course had been
drawn it would have resembled that of a winding river  until they were
so close that she could see the twinkling of their eyes and even the
palpitation of their noses  in spite of what she had said she did not
really care for mice in the neighbourhood of her feet and it was with an
effort that she sat still  thanks to this effort she saw mice for the
first time as they really are—not as creeping things but as dainty
quadrupeds  almost  when they sat up  like tiny kangaroos  with
sensitive kid-gloved forepaws and transparent ears  with quick 
inaudible movements they ranged to and fro till not a crumb was left on
the floor  then he blew a second time on his whistle and with a sudden
whisk of tails all three of them were racing for home and in a few
seconds had disappeared behind the coal box  the director looked at her
with laughter in his eyes  “it is impossible ” thought jane  “to regard
him as old ” “there ” he said  “a very simple adjustment  humans want
crumbs removed  mice are anxious to remove them  it ought never to have
been a cause of war  but you see that obedience and rule are more like a
dance than a drill—specially between man and woman where the roles are
always changing ”

“how huge we must seem to them ” said jane 

this inconsequent remark had a very curious cause  hugeness was what she
was thinking of and for one moment it had seemed she was thinking of her
own hugeness in comparison with the mice  but almost at once this
identification collapsed  she was really thinking simply of hugeness  or
rather  she was not thinking of it  she was  in some strange fashion 
experiencing it  something intolerably big  something from brobdingnag 
was pressing on her  was approaching  was almost in the room  she felt
herself shrinking  suffocated  emptied of all power and virtue  she
darted a glance at the director which was really a cry for help  and
that glance  in some inexplicable way  revealed him as being  like
herself  a very small object  the whole room was a tiny place  a mouses
hole  and it seemed to her to be tilted aslant—as though the
insupportable mass and splendour of this formless hugeness  in
approaching  had knocked it askew  she heard the directors voice 

“quick ” he said gently  “you must leave me now  this is no place for us
small ones  but i am inured  go ”


                                  iii

when jane left the hilltop village of st  annes and came down to the
station she found that  even down there  the fog had begun to lift 
great windows had opened in it  and as the train carried her on it
passed repeatedly through pools of afternoon sunlight 

during this journey she was so divided against herself that one might
say there were three  if not four  janes in the compartment 

the first was a jane simply receptive of the director  recalling every
word and every look  and delighting in them—a jane taken utterly off her
guard  shaken out of the modest little outfit of contemporary ideas
which had hitherto made her portion of wisdom  and swept away on the
flood-tide of an experience which she did not understand and could not
control  for she was trying to control it  that was the function of the
second jane  this second jane regarded the first with disgust  as the
kind of woman  in fact  whom she had always particularly despised  once 
coming out of a cinema  she had heard a little shop girl say to her
friend “oh  wasnt he lovely  if hed looked at me the way he looked at
her  id have followed him to the end of the world ” a little  tawdry 
made-up girl  sucking a peppermint  whether the second jane was right in
equating the first jane with that girl  may be questioned  but she did 
and she found her intolerable  to have surrendered without terms at the
mere voice and look of this stranger  to have abandoned  without
noticing it  that prim little grasp on her own destiny  that perpetual
reservation  which she thought essential to her status as a grown-up 
integrated  intelligent person       the thing was utterly degrading 
vulgar  uncivilised 

the third jane was a new and unexpected visitant  of the first there had
been traces in girlhood  and the second was what jane took to be her
“real” or normal self  but the third one  this moral jane  was one whose
existence she had never suspected  risen from some unknown region of
grace or heredity  it uttered all sorts of things which jane had often
heard before but which had never  till that moment  seemed to be
connected with real life  if it had simply told her that her feelings
about the director were wrong  she would not have been very surprised 
and would have discounted it as the voice of tradition  but it did not 
it kept on blaming her for not having similar feelings about mark  it
kept on pressing into her mind those new feelings about mark  feelings
of guilt and pity  which she had first experienced in the directors
room  it was mark who had made the fatal mistake  she must  must  must
be “nice” to mark  the director obviously insisted on it  at the very
moment when her mind was most filled with another man there arose 
clouded with some undefined emotion  a resolution to give mark much more
than she had ever given him before  and a feeling that in so doing she
would be really giving it to the director  and this produced in her such
a confusion of sensations that the whole inner debate became indistinct
and flowed over into the larger experience of the fourth jane  who was
jane herself and dominated all the rest at every moment without effort
and even without choice 

this fourth and supreme jane was simply in the state of joy  the other
three had no power upon her  for she was in the sphere of jove  amid
light and music and festal pomp  brimmed with life and radiant in
health  jocund and clothed in shining garments  she thought scarcely at
all of the curious sensations which had immediately preceded the
directors dismissal of her and made that dismissal almost a relief 
when she tried to  it immediately led her thoughts back to the director
himself  whatever she tried to think of led back to the director himself
and  in him  to joy  she saw from the windows of the train the outlined
beams of sunlight pouring over stubble or burnished woods and felt that
they were like the notes of a trumpet  her eyes rested on the rabbits
and cows as they flitted by and she embraced them in heart with merry 
holiday love  she delighted in the occasional speech of the one wizened
old man who shared her compartment and saw  as never before  the beauty
of his shrewd and sunny old mind  sweet as a nut and english as a chalk
down  she reflected with surprise how long it was since music had played
any part in her life  and resolved to listen to many chorales by bach on
the gramophone that evening  or else—perhaps—she would read a great many
shakespeare sonnets  she rejoiced also in her hunger and thirst and
decided that she would make herself buttered toast for tea—a great deal
of buttered toast  and she rejoiced also in the consciousness of her own
beauty  for she had the sensation—it may have been false in fact  but it
had nothing to do with vanity—that it was growing and expanding like a
magic flower with every minute that passed  in such a mood it was only
natural  after the old countryman had got out at cure hardy  to stand up
and look at herself in the mirror which confronted her on the wall of
the compartment  certainly she was looking well  she was looking
unusually well  and  once more  there was little vanity in this  for
beauty was made for others  her beauty belonged to the director  it
belonged to him so completely that he could even decide not to keep it
for himself but to order that it be given to another  by an act of
obedience lower  and therefore higher  more unconditional and therefore
more delighting  than if he had demanded it for himself 

as the train came into edgestow station jane was just deciding that she
would not try to get a bus  she would enjoy the walk up to sandown  and
then—what on earth was all this  the platform  usually almost deserted
at this hour  was like a london platform on a bank holiday  “here you
are  mate ” cried a voice as she opened the door  and half a dozen men
crowded into her carriage so roughly that for a moment she could not get
out  she found difficulty in crossing the platform  people seemed to be
going in all directions at once—angry  rough  and excited people  “get
back into the train  quick ” shouted someone  “get out of the station 
if youre not travelling ” bawled another voice  “what the devil ” asked
a third just beside her  and then a womans voice said “oh dear  oh
dear  why dont they  stop  it ” and from outside  beyond the station
came a great roaring noise like the noise of a football crowd  there
seemed to be a lot of unfamiliar lights about 


                                   iv

hours later  bruised  frightened  and tired to death  jane found herself
in a street she did not even know  surrounded by n i c e  policemen and
a few of their females  the waips  her course had been like that of a
man trying to get home along the beach when the tide is coming in  she
had been driven out of her natural route along warwick street—they were
looting shops and making bonfires there—and forced to take a much wider
circle  up by the asylum  which would have brought her home in the end 
then even that wider circle had proved impracticable  for the same
reason  she had been forced to try a still longer way round  and each
time the tide had got there before her  finally she had seen bone lane 
straight and empty and still  and apparently her last chance of getting
home that night at all  a couple of n i c e  police—one seemed to meet
them everywhere except where the rioting was most violent—had shouted
out  “you cant go down there  miss ” but as they then turned their
backs on her  and it was poorly lit  and because she was now desperate 
jane had made a bolt for it  they caught her  and that was how she found
herself being taken into a lighted room and questioned by a uniformed
woman with short grey hair  a square face  and an unlighted cheroot  the
room was in disorder—as if a private house had been suddenly and roughly
converted into a temporary police station  the woman with the cheroot
took no particular interest until jane had given her name  then miss
hardcastle looked her in the face for the first time  and jane felt
quite a new sensation  she was already tired and frightened  but this
was different  the face of the other woman affected her as the face of
some men—fat men with small greedy eyes and strange disquieting
smiles—had affected her when she was in her teens  it was dreadfully
quiet and yet dreadfully interested in her  and jane saw that some quite
new idea was dawning on the woman as she stared at her  some idea that
the woman found attractive  and then tried to put aside  and then
returned to dally with  and then finally  with a little sigh of
contentment  accepted  miss hardcastle lit her cheroot and blew a cloud
of smoke towards her  if jane had known how seldom miss hardcastle
actually smoked she would have been even more alarmed  the policemen and
policewomen who surrounded her probably did  the whole atmosphere of the
room became a little different 

“jane studdock ” said the fairy  “i know all about you  honey  youll be
the wife of my friend mark ” while she spoke she was writing something
on a green form 

“ thats  all right ” said miss hardcastle  “youll be able to see hubby
again now  well take you out to belbury to-night  now  just one
question  dear  what were you doing down here at this time of night ”

“i had just come off a train ”

“and where had you been  honey ”

jane said nothing 

“you hadnt been getting up to mischief while hubby was away  had you ”

“will you please let me go ” said jane  “i want to get home  i am very
tired and its very late ”

“but youre not going home ” said miss hardcastle  “youre coming out to
belbury ”

“my husband has said nothing about my joining him there ”

miss hardcastle nodded  “that was one of his mistakes  but youre coming
with  us  ”

“what do you mean ”

“its an arrest  honey ” said miss hardcastle  holding out the piece of
green paper on which she had been writing  it appeared to jane as all
official forms always appeared—a mass of compartments  some empty  some
full of small print  some scrawled with signatures in pencil  and one
bearing her own name  all meaningless 

“o-oh ” screamed jane suddenly  overcome with a sensation of nightmare 
and made a dash for the door  of course she never reached it  a moment
later she came to her senses and found herself held by the two
policewomen 

“what a naughty temper ” said miss hardcastle playfully  “but well put
the nasty men outside  shall we ” she said something and the policemen
removed themselves and shut the door behind them  as soon as they were
gone jane felt that a protection had been withdrawn from her 

“well ” said miss hardcastle  addressing the two uniformed girls  “lets
see  quarter to one       and all going nicely  i think  daisy  we can
afford ourselves a little stand-easy  be careful  kitty  make your top
grip under her shoulder just a little tighter  thats right ” while she
was speaking miss hardcastle was undoing her belt  and when she had
finished she removed her tunic and flung it on the sofa  revealing a
huge torso  uncorseted  as bill the blizzard had complained   rank 
floppy  and thinly clad  such things as rubens might have painted in
delirium  then she resumed her seat  removed the cheroot from her mouth 
blew another cloud of smoke in janes direction  and addressed her 

“where had you been by that train ” she said 

and jane said nothing  partly because she could not speak  and partly
because she now knew beyond all doubt that these were the enemies of the
human race whom the director was fighting against and one must tell them
nothing  she did not feel heroic in making this decision  the whole
scene was becoming unreal to her  and it was as if between sleeping and
waking that she heard miss hardcastle say  “i think  kitty dear  you and
daisy had better bring her round here ” and it was still only half real
when the two women forced her round to the other side of the table  and
she saw miss hardcastle sitting with her legs wide apart and settling
herself in the chair as if in the saddle  long leather-clad legs
projecting from beneath her short skirt  the women forced her on  with a
skilled  quiet increase of pressure whenever she resisted  until she
stood between miss hardcastles feet  whereupon miss hardcastle brought
her feet together so that she had janes ankles pinioned between her
own  this proximity to the ogress affected jane with such horror that
she had no fears left for what they might be going to do with her  and
for what seemed an endless time miss hardcastle stared at her  smiling a
little and blowing smoke in her face 

“do you know ” said miss hardcastle at last  “youre rather a pretty
little thing in your way ”

there was another silence 

“where had you been by that train ” said miss hardcastle 

and jane stared as if her eyes would start out of her head and said
nothing  then suddenly miss hardcastle leant forward and  after very
carefully turning down the edge of janes dress  thrust the lighted end
of the cheroot against her shoulder  after that there was another pause
and another silence 

“where had you been by that train ” said miss hardcastle 

how many times this happened jane could never remember  but somehow or
other there came a time when miss hardcastle was talking not to her but
to one of the women  “what  are  you fussing about  daisy ” she was
saying 

“i was only saying  maam  it was five past one ”

“how time flies  doesnt it  daisy  but what if it is  arent you
comfortable  daisy  youre not getting tired  holding a little bit of a
thing like her ”

“no maam  thank you  but you did say  maam  youd meet captain ohara
at one sharp ”

“captain ohara ” said miss hardcastle dreamily at first  and then
louder  like one waking from a dream  next moment she had jumped up and
was putting on her tunic  “bless the girl ” she said  “what a pair of
blockheads you are  why didnt you remind me before ”

“well  maam  i didnt exactly like to ”

“like to  what do you think youre there for ”

“you dont like us to interrupt  maam  sometimes  when youre
examining ” said the girl sulkily 

“dont argue ” shouted miss hardcastle  wheeling round and hitting her
cheek a resounding blow with the palm of her hand  “look sharp  get the
prisoner into the car  dont wait to button up her dress  idiots  ill
be after you the moment ive dipped my face in cold water ”

a few seconds later  pinioned between daisy and kitty  but still close
to miss hardcastle  there seemed to be room for five in the back of the
car   jane found herself gliding through the darkness  “better go
through the town as little as possible  joe ” said miss hardcastles
voice  “itll be pretty lively by now  go on to the asylum and work down
those little streets at the back of the close ” there seemed to be all
sorts of strange noises and lights about  at places  too  there seemed
to be a great many people  then there came a moment when jane found that
the car had drawn up  “what the hell are you stopping for ” said miss
hardcastle  for a second or two there was no answer from the driver
except grunts and the noise of unsuccessful attempts to start up the
engine  “whats the matter ” repeated miss hardcastle sharply  “dont
know  maam ” said the driver  still working away  “god ” said miss
hardcastle  “cant you even look after a car  some of you people want a
little humane remedial treatment yourselves ” the street in which they
were was empty but  to judge by the noise  it was near some other street
which was very full and very angry  the man got out  swearing under his
breath  and opened the bonnet of the car  “here ” said miss hardcastle 
“you two hop out  look round for another car—anywhere within five
minutes walk—commandeer it  if you dont find one  be back here in ten
minutes  whatever happens  sharp ” the two other policemen alighted  and
disappeared at the double  miss hardcastle continued pouring abuse on
the driver and the driver continued working at the engine  the noise
grew louder  suddenly the driver straightened himself and turned his
face  jane saw the sweat shining on it in the lamplight  towards miss
hardcastle  “look here  miss ” he said  “thats about enough  see  you
keep a civil tongue in your head  or else come and mend the bloody car
yourself if youre so bloody clever ” “dont you try taking that line
with me  joe ” said miss hardcastle  “or youll find me saying a little
word about you to the ordinary police ” “well  suppose you do ” said
joe  “im beginning to think i might as well be in clink as in your
bucking tea-party  struth  ive been in the military police and ive
been in the black and tans and ive been in the b u f   but they were
all ruddy picnics to this lot  a man got some decent treatment there 
and he had men over him  not a bloody lot of old women ”

“yes  joe ” said miss hardcastle  “but it wouldnt be clink for you this
time if i passed the word to the ordinary cops ”

“oh  it wouldnt  wouldnt it  i might have a story or two to tell about
yourself if it came to that ”

“for the lords sake speak to him nicely  maam ” wailed kitty  “theyre
coming  well catch it proper ” and in fact men running  by twos and
threes  had begun to trickle into the street 

“foot it  girls ” said miss hardcastle  “sharps the word  this way ”

jane found herself hustled out of the car and hurried along between
daisy and kitty  miss hardcastle walked in front  the little party
darted across the street and up an alley on the far side 

“any of you know the way here ” asked miss hardcastle when they had
walked a few steps 

“dont know  im sure  maam ” said daisy 

“im a stranger here myself  maam ” said kitty 

“nice useful lot ive got ” said miss hardcastle  “is there anything you
do know ”

“it doesnt seem to go no farther  maam ” said kitty 

the alley had indeed turned out to be a dead end  miss hardcastle stood
still for a moment  unlike her subordinates  she did not seem to be
frightened  but only pleasantly excited  and rather amused at the white
faces and shaky voices of the girls 

“well ” she said  “this is what i call a night out  youre seeing life 
daisy  arent you  i wonder are any of these houses empty  all locked
anyway  perhaps wed best stay where we are ”

the shouting in the street they had left had grown louder and they could
see a confused mass of humanity surging vaguely in a westward direction 
suddenly it became much louder still and angrier 

“theyve caught joe ” said miss hardcastle  “if he can make himself
heard hell send them up here  blast  this means losing the prisoner 
stop blubbering  daisy  you little fool  quick  we must go down into the
crowd separately  weve a very good chance of getting through  keep your
heads  dont shoot  whatever you do  try to get to billingham at the
cross roads  ta-ta babs  the quieter you keep the less likely we are to
meet again ”

miss hardcastle set off at once  jane saw her stand for a few seconds on
the fringes of the crowd and then disappear into it  the two girls
hesitated and then followed  jane sat down on a doorstep  the burns were
painful where her dress had rubbed against them  but what chiefly
troubled her was extreme weariness  she was also deadly cold and a
little sick  but  above all  tired  so tired she could drop asleep
almost       

she shook herself  there was complete silence all about her  she was
colder than she had ever been before and her limbs ached  “i believe i
 have  been asleep ” she thought  she rose  stretched herself  and
walked down the desolate lamp-lit alley into the larger street  it was
quite empty except for one man in a railway uniform who said “good
morning  miss” as he walked smartly past  she stood for a moment 
undecided  and then began to walk slowly to her right  she put her hand
in the pocket of the coat which daisy and kitty had flung round her
before leaving the flat and found three-quarters of a large slab of
chocolate  she was ravenous and began munching it  just as she finished
she was overtaken by a car which drew up shortly after it had passed
her  “are you all right ” said a man  poking his head out 

“were you hurt in the riot ” said a womans voice from within 

“no       not much       i dont know ” said jane stupidly 

the man stared at her and then got out  “i say ” he said  “you dont
look too good  are you sure youre quite well ” then he turned and spoke
to the woman inside  it seemed so long to jane since she had heard kind 
or even sane  voices that she felt like crying  the unknown couple made
her sit in the car and gave her brandy and  after that  sandwiches 
finally they asked if they could give her a lift home  where was her
home  and jane  somewhat to her surprise  heard her own voice very
sleepily answering  “the manor  at st  annes ” “thats fine ” said the
man  “were making for birmingham and we have to pass it ” then jane
fell asleep at once again  and awoke only to find herself entering a
lighted doorway and being received by a woman in pyjamas and an overcoat
who turned out to be mrs  maggs  but she was too tired to remember how
or where she got to bed 




                                 eight
                          moonlight at belbury 


                                   i

“i am the last person  miss hardcastle ” said the deputy director  “to
wish to interfere with your—er—private pleasures  but  really       ” it
was some hours before breakfast-time and the old gentleman was fully
dressed and unshaven  but if he had been up all night  it was odd that
he had let his fire out  he and the fairy were standing by a cold and
blackened grate in his study 

“she cant be far away ” said fairy hardcastle  “well pick her up some
other time  it was well worth trying  if id got out of her where shed
been—and i should have got it if id had a few minutes longer—why  it
might have turned out to be enemy headquarters  we might have rounded up
the whole gang ”

“it was hardly a suitable occasion      ” began wither  but she
interrupted him 

“we havent so much time to waste  you know  you tell me frost is
already complaining that the womans mind is less accessible  and
according to your own metapsychology  or whatever you call the damned
jargon  that means shes falling under the influence of the other side 
you told me that yourself  wherell we be if you lose touch with her
mind before ive got her body locked up here ”

“i am always  of course ” said wither  “most ready and—er—interested to
hear expressions of your own opinions and would not for a moment deny
that they are  in certain respects  of course  if not in all  of a very
real value  on the other hand  there are matters on which
your—ah—necessarily specialised experience does not entirely qualify
you        an arrest was not contemplated at this stage  the head will 
i fear  take the view that you have exceeded your authority  trespassed
beyond your proper sphere  miss hardcastle  i do not say that i
necessarily agree with him  but we must  all  agree that unauthorised
action——”

“oh  cut it out  wither ” said the fairy  seating herself on the side of
the table  “try that game on the steeles and stones  i know too much
about it  its no bloody good trying the elasticity stunt on me  it was
a golden opportunity  running into that girl  if i hadnt taken it youd
have talked about lack of initiative  as i did  you talk about exceeding
my authority  you cant frighten me  i know bloody well were all for it
if the n i c e  fails  and in the meantime id like to see you do
without me  weve got to get the girl  havent we ”

“but not by an arrest  we have always deprecated anything like violence 
if a mere arrest could have secured the—er—goodwill and collaboration of
mrs  studdock  we should hardly have embarrassed ourselves with the
presence of her husband  and even supposing  merely  of course  for the
purpose of argument  that your action in arresting her could be
justified  i am afraid your conduct of the affair after that is open to
serious criticism ”

“i couldnt tell that the bucking car was going to break down  could i ”

“i do not think ” said wither  “the head could be induced to regard that
as the only miscarriage  once the slightest resistance on this womans
part developed  it was not  in my opinion  reasonable to expect success
by the method you employed  as you are aware  i always deplore anything
that is not perfectly humane  but that is quite consistent with the
position that if more drastic expedients have to be used then they must
be used thoroughly   moderate  pain  such as any ordinary degree of
endurance can resist  is always a mistake  it is no true kindness to the
prisoner  the more scientific and  may i add  more civilised facilities
for coercive examination which we have placed at your disposal here 
might have been successful  i am not speaking officially  miss
hardcastle  and i would not in any sense attempt to anticipate the
reactions of our head  but i should not be doing my duty if i failed to
remind you that complaints from that quarter have already been made 
though not  of course  minuted  as to your tendency to allow a
certain—er—emotional excitement in the disciplinary or remedial side of
your work to distract you from the demands of policy ”

“you wont find anyone can do a job like mine well unless they get some
kick out of it ” said the fairy sulkily 

the deputy director looked at his watch 

“anyway ” said the fairy  “what does the head want to see me  now  for 
ive been on my feet the whole bloody night  i might be allowed a bath
and some breakfast ”

“the path of duty  miss hardcastle ” said wither  “can never be an easy
one  you will not forget that punctuality is one of the points on which
emphasis has sometimes been laid ”

miss hardcastle got up and rubbed her face with her hands  “well  i must
have something to drink before i go in ” she said  wither held out his
hands in deprecation 

“come on  wither  i  must  ” said miss hardcastle 

“you dont think hell smell it ” said wither 

“im not going in without it  anyway ” said she 

the old man unlocked his cupboard and gave her whisky  then the two left
the study and went a long way  right over to the other side of the house
where it joined on to the actual blood transfusion offices  it was all
dark at this hour in the morning  and they went by the light of miss
hardcastles torch—on through carpeted and pictured passages into blank
passages with rubberoid floors and distempered walls and then through a
door they had to unlock  and then through another  all the way miss
hardcastles booted feet made a noise  but the slippered feet of the
deputy director made no noise at all  at last they came to a place where
the lights were on and there was a mixture of animal and chemical
smells  and then to a door which was opened to them after they had
parleyed through a speaking tube  filostrato  wearing a white coat 
confronted them in the doorway 

“enter ” said filostrato  “he expect you for some time ”

“is it in a bad temper ” said miss hardcastle 

“sh ” said wither  “and in any case  my dear lady  i dont think that is
quite the way in which one should speak of our head  his sufferings—in
his peculiar condition  you know——”

“you are to go in at once ” said filostrato  “as soon as you have made
yourselves ready ”

“stop  half a moment ” said miss hardcastle suddenly 

“what is it  be quick  please ” said filostrato 

“im going to be sick ”

“you cannot be sick here  go back  i will give you some x54 at once ”

“its all right now ” said miss hardcastle  “it was only momentary  itd
take more than this to upset me ”

“silence  please ” said the italian  “do not attempt to open the second
door until my assistant has shut the first one behind you  do not speak
more than you can help  do not even say yes when you are given an order 
the head will assume your obedience  do not make sudden movements  do
not get too close  do not shout  and  above all  do not argue  now ”


                                   ii

long after sunrise there came into janes sleeping mind a sensation
which  had she put it into words  would have sung  “be glad thou sleeper
and thy sorrow offcast  i am the gate to all good adventure ” and after
she had waked and found herself lying in pleasant languor with winter
morning sunlight falling across her bed  the mood continued  “he  must 
let me stay here now ” she thought  sometime after this mrs  maggs came
in and lit the fire and brought her breakfast  jane winced as she sat up
in bed for some of the burns had stuck to the strange night-dress
 rather too large for her  in which she found herself clad  there was an
indefinable difference in mrs  maggs behaviour 

“its ever so nice  us both being here  isnt it  mrs  studdock ” she
said  and somehow the tone seemed to imply a closer relation than jane
had envisaged between them  but she was too lazy to wonder much about
it 

shortly after breakfast came miss ironwood  she examined and dressed the
burns  which were not serious 

“you can get up in the afternoon  if you like  mrs  studdock ” she said 
“i should just take a quiet day till then  what would you like to read 
theres a pretty large library ”

“id like the  curdie  books  please ” said jane  “and  mansfield park 
and shakespeares  sonnets  ”

having thus been provided with reading matter for several hours  she
very comfortably went to sleep again 

when mrs  maggs looked in at about four oclock to see if jane was
awake  jane said she would like to get up 

“all right  mrs  studdock ” said mrs  maggs  “just as you like  ill
bring you along a nice cup of tea in a minute and then ill get the
bathroom ready for you  theres a bathroom next door almost  only ill
have to get that mr  bultitude out of it  hes that lazy  and he  will 
go in and sit there all day when its cold weather ”

as soon as mrs  maggs had gone  however  jane decided to get up  she
felt that her social abilities were quite equal to dealing with the
eccentric mr  bultitude  and she did not want to waste any more time in
bed  she had an idea that if once she were “up and about” all sorts of
pleasant and interesting things might happen  accordingly she put on her
coat  took her towel  and proceeded to explore  and that was why mrs 
maggs  coming upstairs with the tea a moment later  heard a suppressed
shriek and saw jane emerge from the bathroom with a white face and slam
the door behind her 

“oh dear ” said mrs  maggs  bursting into laughter  “i ought to have
told you  never mind  ill soon have him out of that ” she set the
tea-tray down on the passage floor and turned to the bathroom 

“is it safe ” asked jane 

“oh yes  hes  safe  alright ” said mrs  maggs  “but hes not that easy
to shift  not for you or me  mrs  studdock  of course if it was miss
ironwood or the director it would be another matter ” with that she
opened the bathroom door  inside  sitting up on its hunkers beside the
bath and occupying most of the room  was a great  snuffly  wheezy 
beady-eyed  loose-skinned  gor-bellied brown bear  which  after a great
many reproaches  appeals  exhortations  pushes  and blows from mrs 
maggs  heaved up its enormous bulk and came very slowly out into the
passage 

“why dont you go out and take some exercise that lovely afternoon  you
great lazy thing ” said mrs  maggs  “you ought to be ashamed of
yourself  sitting there getting in everyones way  dont be frightened 
mrs  studdock  hes as tame as tame  hell let you stroke him  go on 
mr  bultitude  go and say how do you do to the lady ”

jane extended a hesitant and unconvincing hand to touch the animals
back  but mr  bultitude was sulking  and without a glance at jane
continued his slow walk along the passage to a point about ten yards
away where he quite suddenly sat down  the tea things rattled at janes
feet  and everyone on the floor below must have known that mr  bultitude
had sat down 

“is it really safe to have a creature like that loose about the house ”
said jane 

“mrs  studdock ” said ivy maggs with some solemnity  “if the director
wanted to have a tiger about the house it would be safe  thats the way
he has with animals  there isnt a creature in the place that would go
for another or for us once hes had his little talk with them  just the
same as he does with us  youll see ”

“if you would put the tea in my room      ” said jane rather coldly  and
went into the bathroom 

“yes ” said mrs  maggs  standing in the open doorway  “you might have
had your bath with mr  bultitude sitting there beside you—though hes
that big and that human i dont somehow feel it would be nice myself ”

jane made to shut the door 

“well  ill leave you  to  it  then ” said mrs  maggs without moving 

“thank you ” said jane 

“sure you got everything you want ” said mrs  maggs 

“quite sure ” said jane 

“well  ill be getting along  then ” said mrs  maggs  turning as if to
go  but almost instantly turning back again to say  “youll find us in
the kitchen  i expect  mother dimble and me and the rest ”

“is mrs  dimble staying in the house ” asked jane with a slight emphasis
on the  mrs  

“ mother  dimble we all call her here ” said mrs  maggs  “and im sure
she wont mind you doing the same  youll get used to our ways in a day
or two   im  sure  its a funny house really  when you come to think of
it  well  ill be getting along  then  dont take too long or your tea
wont be worth drinking  but i dare say youd better not have a bath 
not with those nasty places on your chest  got all you want ”

when jane had washed and had tea and dressed herself with as much care
as strange hairbrushes and a strange mirror allowed  she set out to look
for the inhabited rooms  she passed down one long passage  through that
silence which is not quite like any other in the world—the silence
upstairs  in a big house  on a winter afternoon  presently she came to a
place where two passages met  and here the silence was broken by a faint
irregular noise        pob       pob       pob-pob   looking to her
right she saw the explanation  for where the passage ended in a bay
window stood mr  bultitude  this time on his hind legs  meditatively
boxing a punch-ball  jane chose the way to her left and came to a
gallery whence she looked down the staircase into a large hall where
daylight mixed with firelight  on the same level with herself  but only
to be reached by descending to a landing and ascending again  were
shadowy regions which she recognised as leading to the directors room 
a sort of solemnity seemed to her to emanate from them and she went down
into the hall almost on tiptoes  and now  for the first time  her memory
of that last and curious experience in the blue room came back to her
with a weight which even the thought of the director himself could not
counteract  when she reached the hall she saw at once where the back
premises of the house must lie—down two steps and along a paved passage 
past a stuffed pike in a glass case and then past a grandfather clock 
and then  guided by voices and other sounds  to the kitchen itself 

a wide  open hearth glowing with burning wood lit up the comfortable
form of mrs  dimble who was seated in a kitchen chair at one side of it 
apparently  from the basin in her lap and other indications on a table
beside her  engaged in preparing vegetables  mrs  maggs and camilla were
doing something at a stove—the hearth was apparently not used for
cooking—and in a doorway  which doubtless led to the scullery  a tall
grizzle-headed man  who wore gum-boots and seemed to have just come from
the garden  was drying his hands 

“come in  jane ” said mother dimble  “were not expecting you to do any
work to-day  come and sit on the other side of the fire and talk to me 
this is mr  macphee—who has no right to be here  but hed better be
introduced to you ”

mr  macphee  having finished the drying process and carefully hung the
towel behind the door  advanced rather ceremoniously and shook hands
with jane  his own hand was very large and coarse in texture  and he had
a shrewd hard-featured face 

“i am very glad to see you  mrs  studdock ” he said in what jane took to
be a scotch accent  though it was really that of an ulsterman 

“dont believe a word he says  jane ” said mother dimble  “hes your
prime enemy in this house  he doesnt believe in your dreams ”

“mrs  dimble ” said macphee  “i have repeatedly explained to you the
distinction between a personal feeling of confidence and a logical
satisfaction of the claims of evidence  the one is a psychological
event——”

“and the other a perpetual nuisance ” said mrs  dimble 

“never heed her  mrs  studdock ” said macphee  “i am  as i was saying 
very glad to welcome you among us  the fact that i have found it my duty
on several occasions to point out that no  experimentum crucis  has yet
confirmed the hypothesis that your dreams are veridical  has no
connection in the world with my personal attitude ”

“of course ” said jane vaguely  and a little confused  “im sure you
have a right to your own opinions ”

all the women laughed as macphee in a somewhat louder tone replied 
“mrs  studdock  i have  no  opinions—on any subject in the world  i
state the facts and exhibit the implications  if everyone indulged in
fewer opinions”  he pronounced the word with emphatic disgust  “thered
be less silly talking and printing in the world ”

“i know who talks most in this house ” said mrs  maggs  somewhat to
janes surprise 

the ulsterman eyed the last speaker with an unaltered face while
producing a small pewter box from his pocket and helping himself to a
pinch of snuff 

“what are you waiting for  anyway ” said mrs  maggs  “womens day in the
kitchen to-day ”

“i was wondering ” said macphee  “whether you had a cup of tea saved for
me ”

“and why didnt you come in at the right time  then ” said mrs  maggs 
jane noticed that she talked to him much as she had talked to the bear 

“i was busy ” said the other  seating himself at one end of the table 
and added after a pause  “trenching celery  the wee woman does the best
she can  but she has a poor notion of what needs doing in a garden ”

“what is womens day in the kitchen ” asked jane of mother dimble 

“there are no servants here ” said mother dimble  “and we all do the
work  the women do it one day and the men the next        what       
no  its a very sensible arrangement  the directors idea is that men
and women cant do housework together without quarrelling  theres
something in it  of course it doesnt do to look at the cups too closely
on the mens day  but on the whole we get along pretty well ”

“but why should they quarrel ” asked jane 

“different methods  my dear  men cant  help  in a job  you know  they
can be induced to do it  not to help while youre doing it  at least it
makes them grumpy ”

“the cardinal difficulty ” said macphee  “in collaboration between the
sexes is that women speak a language without nouns  if two men are doing
a bit of work one will say to the other  put this bowl inside the
bigger bowl which youll find on the top shelf of the green cupboard 
the female for this is put that in the other one in there  and then if
you ask them in where  they say in  there  of course  there is
consequently a phatic hiatus ” he pronounced this so as to rhyme with
“get  at  us ”

“theres your tea now ” said ivy maggs  “and ill go and get you a piece
of cake  which is more than you deserve  and when youve had it you can
go upstairs and talk about nouns for the rest of the evening ”

“not  about  nouns   by means of  nouns ” said macphee  but mrs  maggs
had already left the room  jane took advantage of this to say to mother
dimble in a lower voice  “mrs  maggs seems to make herself very much at
home here ”

“my dear  she  is  at home here ”

“as a maid  you mean ”

“well  no more than anyone else  shes here chiefly because her house
has been taken from her  she had nowhere else to go ”

“you mean she is       one of the directors charities ”

“certainly that  why do you ask ”

“well       i dont know  it  did  seem a little odd that she should
call you mother dimble  i hope im not being snobbish      ”

“youre forgetting that cecil and i are another of the directors
charities ”

“isnt that rather playing on words ”

“not a bit  ivy and cecil and i are all here because we were turned out
of our homes  at least ivy and i are  it may be rather different for
cecil ”

“and does the director know that mrs  maggs talks to everyone like
that ”

“my dear child  dont ask me what the director knows ”

“i think whats puzzling me is that when i saw him he said something
about equality not being the important thing  but his own house seems to
be run on       well on very democratic lines indeed ”

“i never attempt to understand what he says on that subject ” said
mother dimble  “hes usually talking either about spiritual ranks—and
you were never goose enough to think yourself  spiritually  superior to
ivy—or else about marriage ”

“did you understand his views on marriage ”

“my dear  the director is a very wise man  but he  is  a man  after all 
and an unmarried man at that  some of what he says  or what the masters
say  about marriage does seem to me to be a lot of fuss about something
so simple and natural that it oughtnt to need saying at all  but i
suppose there are young women nowadays who need to be told it ”

“you havent got much use for young women who do  i see ”

“well  perhaps im unfair  things were easier for us  we were brought up
on stories with happy endings and on the prayer book  we always intended
to love  honour  and obey  and we had figures and we wore petticoats and
we liked waltzes      ”

“waltzes are ever so nice ” said mrs  maggs—who had just returned and
given macphee his slab of cake—“so old-fashioned ”

at that moment the door opened and a voice from behind it said  “well 
go in then  if youre going ” thus admonished  a very fine jackdaw
hopped into the room  followed firstly by mr  bultitude and secondly by
arthur denniston 

“ive told you before  arthur ” said ivy maggs  “not to bring that bear
in here when were cooking the dinner ” while she was speaking mr 
bultitude  who was apparently himself uncertain of his welcome  walked
across the room in what he believed  erroneously  to be an unobtrusive
manner and sat down behind mrs  dimbles chair 

“dr  dimbles just come back  mother dimble ” said denniston  “but hes
had to go straight to the blue room  and the director wants you to go to
him  too  macphee ”


                                  iii

mark sat down to lunch that day in good spirits  everyone reported that
the riot had gone off most satisfactorily  and he had enjoyed reading
his own accounts of it in the morning papers  he enjoyed it even more
when he heard steele and cosser talking about it in a way which showed
that they did not even know how it had been engineered  much less who
had written it up in the newspapers  and he had enjoyed his morning 
too  it had involved a conversation with frost  the fairy  and wither
himself  about the future of edgestow  all were agreed that the
government would follow the almost unanimous opinion of the nation  as
expressed in the newspapers  and put it temporarily under the control of
the institutional police  an emergency governor of edgestow must be
appointed  feverstone was the obvious man  as a member of parliament he
represented the nation  as a fellow of bracton he represented the
university  as a member of the institute he represented the institute 
all the competing claims that might otherwise have come into collision
were reconciled in the person of lord feverstone  the articles on this
subject which mark was to write that afternoon would almost write
themselves  but that had not been all  as the conversation proceeded it
had become clear that there was really a double object in getting this
invidious post for feverstone  when the time came  and the local
unpopularity of the n i c e  rose to its height  he could be sacrificed 
this  of course  was not said in so many words  but mark realised
perfectly clearly that even feverstone was no longer quite in the inner
ring  the fairy said that old dick was a mere politician at heart and
always would be  wither  deeply sighing  confessed that his talents had
been perhaps more useful at an earlier stage of the movement than they
were likely to be in the period on which they were now entering  there
was in marks mind no plan for undermining feverstone nor even a fully
formed wish that he should be undermined  but the whole atmosphere of
the discussion became somehow more agreeable to him as he began to
understand the real situation  he was also pleased that he had  as he
would have put it  “got to know” frost  he knew by experience that there
is in almost every organisation some quiet  inconspicuous person whom
the small fry suppose to be of no importance but who is really one of
the mainsprings of the whole machine  even to recognise such people for
what they are shows that one has made considerable progress  there was 
to be sure  a cold fish-like quality about frost which mark did not like
and something even repulsive about the regularity of his features  but
every word he spoke  he did not speak many  went to the root of what was
being discussed  and mark found it delightful to speak to him  the
pleasures of conversation were coming  for mark  to have less and less
connection with his spontaneous liking or disliking of the people he
talked to  he was aware of this change—which had begun when he joined
the progressive element in college—and welcomed it as a sign of
maturity 

wither had thawed in a most encouraging manner  at the end of the
conversation he had taken mark aside  spoken vaguely but paternally of
the great work he was doing  and finally asked after his wife  the d d 
hoped there was no truth in the rumour which had reached him that she
was suffering from—er—some nervous disorder  “who the devil has been
telling him that ” thought mark  “because ” said wither  “it had
occurred to me  in view of the great pressure of work which rests on you
at present and the difficulty  therefore  of your being at home as much
as we should all  for your sake  wish  that in  your  case the institute
might be induced       i am speaking in a quite informal way       that
we should all be delighted to welcome mrs  studdock here ”

until the d d  had said this mark had not realised that there was
nothing he would dislike so much as having jane at belbury  there were
so many things that jane would not understand  not only the pretty heavy
drinking which was becoming his habit but—oh  everything from morning to
night  for it is only justice both to mark and to jane to record that he
would have found it impossible to conduct in her hearing any one of the
hundred conversations which his life at belbury involved  her mere
presence would have made all the laughter of the inner ring sound
metallic  unreal  and what he now regarded as common prudence would seem
to her  and through her to himself  mere flattery  back-biting  and toad
eating  jane in the middle of belbury would turn the whole of belbury
into a vast vulgarity  flashy and yet furtive  his mind sickened at the
thought of trying to teach jane that she must help to keep wither in a
good temper and must play up to fairy hardcastle  he excused himself
vaguely to the d d   with profuse thanks  and got away as quickly as he
could 

that afternoon  while he was having tea  fairy hardcastle came and
leaned over the back of his chair and said in his ear 

“ youve  torn it  studdock ”

“whats the matter now  fairy ” said he 

“i cant make out whats the matter with  you   young studdock  and
thats a fact  have you made up your mind to annoy the old man  because
its a dangerous game  you know ”

“what on earth are you talking about ”

“well  here weve all been working on your behalf and soothing him down
and this morning we thought wed finally succeeded  he was talking about
giving you the appointment originally intended for you and waiving the
probationary period  not a cloud in the sky  and then you have five
minutes chat with him—barely five minutes  in fact—and in that time
youve managed to undo it all  i begin to think youre mental ”

“what the devils wrong with him this time ”

“well  you  ought to know  didnt he say something about bringing your
wife here ”

“yes he did  what about it ”

“and what did you say ”

“i said not to bother about it       and  of course  thanked him very
much and all that ” the fairy whistled 

“dont you see  honey ” she said  gently rapping marks scalp with her
knuckles  “that you could hardly have made a worse bloomer  it was a
most terrific concession for him to make  hes never done it to anyone
else  you might have known hed be offended if you cold-shouldered him 
hes burbling away now about lack of confidence  says hes hurt  which
means that somebody else soon will be  he takes your refusal as a sign
that you are not really settled here ”

“but that is sheer madness  i mean      ”

“why the blazes couldnt you tell him youd have your wife here ”

“isnt that my own business ”

“dont you want to have her  youre not very polite to little wifie 
studdock  and they tell me shes a damned pretty girl ”

at that moment the form of wither  slowly sauntering in their direction 
became apparent to both and the conversation ended 

at dinner he sat next to filostrato  there were no other members of the
inner circle within earshot  the italian was in good spirits and
talkative  he had just given orders for the cutting down of some fine
beech trees in the grounds 

“why have you done that  professor ” said a mr  winter who sat opposite 
“i shouldnt have thought they did much harm at that distance from the
house  im rather fond of trees myself ”

“oh yes  yes ” replied filostrato  “the pretty trees  the garden trees 
but not the savages  i put the rose in my garden  but not the briar  the
forest tree is a weed  but i tell you i have seen the civilised tree in
persia  it was a french  attaché  who had it  because he was in a place
where trees do not grow  it was made of metal  a poor  crude thing  but
how if it were perfected  light  made of aluminium  so natural  it would
even deceive ”

“it would hardly be the same as a real tree ” said winter 

“but consider the advantages  you get tired of him in one place  two
workmen carry him somewhere else  wherever you please  it never dies  no
leaves to fall  no twigs  no birds building nests  no muck and mess ”

“i suppose one or two  as curiosities  might be rather amusing ”

“why one or two  at present  i allow  we must have forest for the
atmosphere  presently we find a chemical substitute  and then  why  any 
natural trees  i foresee nothing but the  art  tree all over the earth 
in fact  we  clean  the planet ”

“do you mean ” put in a man called gould  “that we are to have no
vegetation at all ”

“exactly  you shave your face  even  in the english fashion  you shave
him every day  one day we shave the planet ”

“i wonder what the birds will make of it ”

“i would not have any birds either  on the art tree i would have the art
birds all singing when you press a switch inside the house  when you are
tired of the singing you switch them off  consider again the
improvement  no feathers dropped about  no nests  no eggs  no dirt ”

“it sounds ” said mark  “like abolishing pretty well all organic life ”

“and why not  it is simple hygiene  listen  my friends  if you pick up
some rotten thing and find this organic life crawling over it  do you
not say  oh  the horrid thing  it is alive  and then drop it ”

“go on ” said winter 

“and you  especially you english  are you not hostile to any organic
life except your own on your own body  rather than permit it you have
invented the daily bath ”

“thats true ”

“and what do you call dirty dirt  is it not precisely the organic 
minerals are clean dirt  but the real filth is what comes from
organisms—sweat  spittles  excretions  is not your whole idea of purity
one huge example  the impure and the organic are interchangeable
conceptions ”

“what are you driving at  professor ” said gould  “after all we are
organisms ourselves ”

“i grant it  that is the point  in us organic life has produced mind  it
has done its work  after that we want no more of it  we do not want the
world any longer furred over with organic life  like what you call the
blue mould—all sprouting and budding and breeding and decaying  we must
get rid of it  by little and little  of course  slowly we learn how 
learn to make our brains live with less and less body  learn to build
our bodies directly with chemicals  no longer have to stuff them full of
dead brutes and weeds  learn how to reproduce ourselves without
copulation ”

“i dont think that would be much fun ” said winter 

“my friend  you have already separated the fun  as you call it  from the
fertility  the fun itself begins to pass away  bah  i know that is not
what you think  but look at your english women  six out of ten are
frigid are they not  you see  nature herself begins to throw away the
anachronism  when she has quite thrown it away  then real civilisation
becomes possible  you would understand if you were peasants  who would
try to work with stallions and bulls  no  no  we want geldings and oxen 
there will never be peace and order and discipline so long as there is
sex  when man has thrown it away  then he will become finally
governable ”

this brought them to the end of dinner  and as they rose from the table
filostrato whispered in marks ear  “i would not advise the library for
you to-night  you understand  you are not in favour  come and have a
little conversation with me in my room ”

mark rose and followed him  glad and surprised that in this new crisis
with the d d  filostrato was apparently still his friend  they went up
to the italians sitting-room on the first floor  there mark sat down
before the fire  but his host continued to walk up and down the room 

“i am very sorry  my young friend ” said filostrato  “to hear of this
new trouble between you and the deputy director  it must be stopped  you
understand  if he invite you to bring your wife here why do you not
bring her ”

“well  really ” said mark  “i never knew he attached so much importance
to it  i thought he was merely being polite ” his objection to having
jane at belbury had been  if not removed  at least temporarily deadened
by the wine he had drunk at dinner and by the sharp pang he had felt at
the threat of expulsion from the library circle 

“it is of no importance in itself ” said filostrato  “but i have reason
to believe it came not from wither but from the head himself ”

“the head  you mean jules ” said mark in some surprise  “i thought he
was a mere figure head  and why should  he  care whether i bring my wife
here or not ”

“you were mistaken ” said filostrato  “our head is no figure head ”
there was something odd about his manner  mark thought  for some time
neither man spoke 

“it is all true ” said filostrato at last  “what i said at dinner ”

“but about jules ” said mark  “what business is it of his ”

“jules ” said filostrato  “why do you speak of him  i say it was all
true  the world i look forward to is the world of perfect purity  the
clean mind and the clean minerals  what are the things that most offend
the dignity of man  birth and breeding and death  how if we are about to
discover that mind can live without any of the three ”

mark stared  filostratos conversation appeared so disjointed and his
manner so unusual that he began to wonder if he were quite sane or quite
sober 

“as for your wife ” resumed filostrato  “i attach no importance to it 
what have i to do with mens wives  the whole subject disgusts me  but
if they make a point of it       look  my friend  the real question is
whether you mean to be truly at one with us or no ”

“i dont quite follow ” said mark 

“do you want to be a mere hireling  but you have already come too far in
for that  you are at the turning-point of your career  mr  studdock  if
you try to go back you will be as unfortunate as the fool hingest  if
you come really in—the world       bah  what do i say        the
universe is at your feet ”

“but of course i want to come in ” said mark  a certain excitement was
stealing over him 

“the head thinks that you cannot be really one of us if you will not
bring your wife here  he will have all of you  and all that is yours—or
else nothing  you must bring the woman in too  she also must be one of
us ”

this remark was like a shock of cold water in marks face  and yet      
and yet       in that room and at that moment  fixed with the little 
bright eyes of the professor  he could hardly make the thought of jane
quite real to himself 

“you shall hear it from the lips of the head himself ” said filostrato
suddenly 

“is jules  here  ” said mark 

instead of answering filostrato turned sharply from him and with a great
scraping movement flung back the window curtains  then he switched off
the light  the fog had all gone  the wind had risen  small clouds were
scudding across the stars and the full moon—mark had never seen her so
bright—stared down upon them  as the clouds passed her she looked like a
ball that was rolling through them  her bloodless light filled the room 

“there is a world for you  no ” said filostrato  “there is cleanness 
purity  thousands of square miles of polished rock with not one blade of
grass  not one fibre of lichen  not one grain of dust  not even air 
have you thought what it would be like  my friend  if you could walk on
that land  no crumbling  no erosion  the peaks of those mountains are
real peaks  sharp as needles  they would go through your hand  cliffs as
high as everest and as straight as the wall of a house  and cast by
those cliffs  acres of shadow black as ebony  and in the shadow hundreds
of degrees of frost  and then  one step beyond the shadow  light that
would pierce your eyeballs like steel and rock that would burn your
feet  the temperature is at boiling-point  you would die  yes  but even
then you would not become filth  in a few moments you are a little heap
of ash  clean  white powder  and mark  no wind to blow that powder
about  every grain in the little heap remain in its place  just where
you died  till the end of the world       but that is nonsense  the
universe will have no end ”

“yes  a dead world ” said mark  gazing at the moon 

“no ” said filostrato  he had come close to mark and spoke almost in a
whisper  the bat-like whisper of a voice that is naturally high-pitched 
“no  there is life there ”

“do we  know  that ” asked mark 

“oh   si   intelligent life  under the surface  a great race  further
advanced than we  an inspiration  a  pure  race  they have cleaned their
world  broken free  almost  from the organic ”

“but how—— ”

“they do not need to be born and breed and die  only their common
people  their  canaglia  do that  the masters live on  they retain their
intelligence  they can keep it artificially alive after the organic body
has been dispensed with—a miracle of applied biochemistry  they do not
need organic food  you understand  they are almost free of nature 
attached to her only by the thinnest  finest cord ”

“do you mean that all  that  ” mark pointed to the mottled white globe
of the moon  “is their own doing ”

“why not  if you remove all the vegetation  presently you have no
atmosphere  no water ”

“but what was the purpose ”

“hygiene  why should they have their world all crawling with organisms 
and specially  they would banish one organism  her surface is not all as
you see  there are still surface-dwellers—savages  one great dirty patch
on the far side of her where there is still water and air and
forests—yes  and germs and death  they are slowly spreading their
hygiene over their whole globe  disinfecting her  the savages fight
against them  there are frontiers  and fierce wars  in the caves and
galleries down below  but the great race press on  if you could see the
other side you would see year by year the clean rock—like this side of
the moon—encroaching  the organic stain  all the green and blue and
mist  growing smaller  like cleaning tarnished silver ”

“but how do we know all this ”

“i will tell you all that another time  the head has many sources of
information  for the moment  i speak only to inspire you  i speak that
you may know what can be done  what shall be done here  this
institute— dio mio   it is for something better than housing and
vaccinations and faster trains and curing the people of cancer  it is
for the conquest of death  or for the conquest of organic life  if you
prefer  they are the same thing  it is to bring out of that cocoon of
organic life which sheltered the babyhood of mind the new man  the man
who will not die  the artificial man  free from nature  nature is the
ladder we have climbed up by  now we kick her away ”

“and you think that some day we shall really find a means of keeping the
brain alive indefinitely ”

“we have begun already  the head himself      ”

“go on ” said mark  his heart was beating wildly and he had forgotten
both jane and wither  this at last was the real thing 

“the head himself has already survived death  and you shall speak to him
this night ”

“do you mean that jules has died ”

“bah  jules is nothing  he is not the head ”

“then who is ”

at this moment there was a knock on the door  someone  without waiting
for an answer  came in 

“is the young man ready ” asked the voice of straik 

“oh yes  you are ready  are you not  mr  studdock ”

“you have explained it to him  then ” said straik  he turned to mark and
the moonlight in the room was so bright that mark could now partially
recognise his face—its harsh furrows emphasised by that cold light and
shade 

“do you mean really to join us  young man ” said straik  “there is no
turning back once you have set your hand to the plough  and there are no
reservations  the head has sent for you  do you understand— the head  
you will look upon one who was killed and is still alive  the
resurrection of jesus in the bible was a symbol  to-night you shall see
what it symbolised  this is real man at last  and it claims all our
allegiance ”

“what the devil are you talking about ” said mark  the tension of his
nerves distorted his voice into a hoarse blustering cry 

“my friend is quite right ” said filostrato  “our head is the first of
the new men—the first that lives beyond animal life  as far as nature is
concerned he is already dead  if nature had her way his brain would now
be mouldering in the grave  but he will speak to you within this hour 
and—a word in your ear  my friend—you will obey his orders ”

“but who  is  it ” said mark 

“it is françois alcasan ” said filostrato 

“you mean the man who was guillotined ” gasped mark  both the heads
nodded  both faces were close to him  in that disastrous light they
looked like masks hanging in the air 

“you are frightened ” said filostrato  “you will get over that  we are
offering to make you one of us   ahi —if you were outside  if you were
mere  canaglia  you would have reason to be frightened  it is the
beginning of all power  he live forever  the giant time is conquered 
and the giant space—he was already conquered too  one of our company has
already travelled in space  true  he was betrayed and murdered and his
manuscripts are imperfect  we have not yet been able to reconstruct his
space ship  but that will come ”

“it is the beginning of man immortal and man ubiquitous ” said straik 
“man on the throne of the universe  it is what all the prophecies really
meant ”

“at first  of course ” said filostrato  “the power will be confined to a
number—a small number—of individual men  those who are selected for
eternal life ”

“and you mean ” said mark  “it will then be extended to all men ”

“no ” said filostrato  “i mean it will then be reduced to one man  you
are not a fool  are you  my young friend  all that talk about the power
of man over nature—man in the abstract—is only for the  canaglia   you
know as well as i do that mans power over nature means the power of
some men over other men with nature as the instrument  there is no such
thing as man—it is a word  there are only men  no  it is not man who
will be omnipotent  it is some one man  some immortal man  alcasan  our
head  is the first sketch of it  the completed product may be someone
else  it may be you  it may be me ”

“a king cometh ” said straik  “who shall rule the universe with
righteousness and the heavens with judgement  you thought all that was
mythology  no doubt  you thought because fables had clustered about the
phrase son of man that man would never really have a son who will
wield all power  but he will ”

“i dont understand  i dont understand ” said mark 

“but it is very easy ” said filostrato  “we have found how to make a
dead man live  he was a wise man even in his natural life  he live now
forever  he get wiser  later  we make them live better—for at present 
one must concede  this second life is probably not very agreeable to him
who has it  you see  later we make it pleasant for some—perhaps not so
pleasant for others  for we can make the dead live whether they wish it
or not  he who shall be finally king of the universe can give this life
to whom he pleases  they cannot refuse the little present ”

“and so ” said straik  “the lessons you learned at your mothers knee
return  god will have power to give eternal reward and eternal
punishment ”

“god ” said mark  “how does he come into it  i dont believe in god ”

“but  my friend ” said filostrato  “does it follow that because there
was no god in the past that there will be no god also in the future ”

“dont you see ” said straik  “that we are offering you the unspeakable
glory of being present at the creation of god almighty  here  in this
house  you shall meet the first draught of the real god  it is a man—or
a being made by man—who will finally ascend the throne of the universe 
and rule forever ”

“you will come with us ” said filostrato  “he has sent for you ”

“of course he will come ” said straik  “does he think he could hold back
and live ”

“and that little affair of the wife ” added filostrato  “you will not
mention a triviality like that  you will do as you are told  one does
not argue with the head ”

mark had nothing now to help him but the rapidly ebbing exhilaration of
the alcohol taken at dinner-time and some faint gleams of memory from
hours with jane and with friends made before he went to bracton  during
which the world had had a different taste from this exciting horror
which now pressed upon him  these  and a merely instinctive dislike for
both the moonlit faces which so held his attention  on the other side
was fear  what would they do to him if he refused now  and aiding fear
was this young mans belief that if one gave in for the present things
would somehow right themselves “in the morning ” and  aiding the fear
and the hope  there was still  even then  a not wholly disagreeable
thrill at the thought of sharing so stupendous a secret 

“yes ” he said  halting in his speech as if he were out of breath 
“yes—of course—ill come ”

they led him out  the passages were already still and the sound of talk
and laughter from the public rooms on the ground floor had ceased  he
stumbled  and they linked arms with him  the journey seemed long 
passage after passage  passages he had never seen before  doors to
unlock  and then into a place where all the lights were on  and there
were strange smells  then filostrato spoke through a speaking-tube and a
door was opened to them 

mark found himself in a surgical-looking room with glaring lights  and
sinks  and bottles  and glittering instruments  a young man whom he
hardly knew  dressed in a white coat  received them 

“strip to your underclothes ” said filostrato  while mark was obeying he
noticed that the opposite wall of the room was covered with dials 
numbers of flexible tubes came out of the floor and went into the wall
just beneath the dials  the staring dial faces and the bunches of tubes
beneath them  which seemed to be faintly pulsating  gave one the
impression of looking at some creature with many eyes and many
tentacles  the young man kept his eyes fixed on the vibrating needles of
the dials  when the three newcomers had removed their outer clothes 
they washed their hands and faces  and after that filostrato plucked
white clothes for them out of a glass container with a pair of forceps 
when they had put these on he gave them also gloves and masks such as
surgeons wear  there followed a moments silence while filostrato
studied the dials  “yes  yes ” he said  “a little more air  not much 
point nought three  turn on the chamber air       slowly       to full 
now the lights  now air in the lock  a little less of the solution  and
now”  here he turned to straik and studdock  “are you ready to go in ”

he led them to a door in the same wall as the dials 




                                  nine
                           the saracens head

“it was the worst dream ive had yet ” said jane next morning  she was
seated in the blue room with the director and grace ironwood 

“yes ” said the director  “yours is perhaps the hardest post  until the
real struggle begins ”

“i dreamed i was in a dark room ” said jane  “with queer smells in it
and a sort of low humming noise  then the light came on—but not very
much light  and for a long time i didnt realise what i was looking at 
and when i made it out       i should have waked up if i hadnt made a
great effort not to  i thought i saw a face floating just in front of
me  a face  not a head  if you understand what i mean  that is  there
was a beard and nose and eyes—at least  you couldnt see the eyes
because it had coloured glasses on  but there didnt seem to be anything
above the eyes  not at first  but as i got used to the light  i got a
horrible shock  i thought the face was a mask tied on to a kind of
balloon thing  but it wasnt  exactly  perhaps it looked a bit like a
man wearing a sort of turban       im telling this dreadfully badly 
what it really was  was a head  the rest of a head  which had had the
top part of the skull taken off and then       then       as if
something inside had boiled over  a great big mass which bulged out from
inside what was left of the skull  wrapped in some kind of composition
stuff  but very thin stuff  you could see it twitch  even in my fright i
remember thinking  oh  kill it  kill it  put it out of its pain  but
only for a second  because i thought the thing was dead  really  it was
green looking and the mouth was wide open and quite dry  you realise i
was a long time  looking at it  before anything else happened  and soon
i saw that it wasnt exactly floating  it was fixed up on some kind of
bracket  or shelf  or pedestal—i dont know quite what  and there were
things hanging from it  from the neck  i mean  yes  it had a neck and a
sort of collar thing round it  but nothing below the collar  no
shoulders or body  only these hanging things  in the dream i thought it
was some kind of new man that had only head and entrails  i thought all
those tubes were its insides  but presently—i dont quite know how  i
saw that they were artificial  little rubber tubes and bulbs and little
metal things too  i couldnt understand them  all the tubes went into
the wall  then at last something happened ”

“youre all right  jane  are you ” said miss ironwood 

“oh yes ” said jane  “as far as that goes  only one somehow doesnt
 want  to tell it  well  quite suddenly  like when an engine is started 
there came a puff of air out of its mouth  with a hard dry rasping
sound  and then there came another  and it settled down into a sort of
rhythm— huff  huff  huff —like an imitation of breathing  then came a
most horrible thing  the mouth began to dribble  i know it sounds silly
but in a way i felt sorry for it  because it had no hands and couldnt
wipe its mouth  it seems a small thing compared with all the rest but
that is how i felt  then it began working its mouth about and even
licking its lips  it was like someone getting a machine into working
order  to see it doing that just as if it was alive  and at the same
time dribbling over the beard which was all stiff and dead looking       
then three people came into the room  all dressed up in white  with
masks on  walking as carefully as cats on the top of a wall  one was a
great fat man  and another was lanky and boney  the third      ” here
jane paused involuntarily  “the third       i think it was mark       i
mean my husband ”

“you are uncertain ” said the director 

“no ” said jane  “it was mark  i knew his walk  and i knew the shoes he
was wearing  and his voice  it  was  mark ”

“i am sorry ” said the director 

“and then ” said jane  “all three of them came round and stood in front
of the head  they bowed to it  you couldnt tell if it was looking at
them because of its dark glasses  it kept on with that rhythmical
huffing noise  then it spoke ”

“in english ” said grace ironwood 

“no  in french ”

“what did it say ”

“well  my french wasnt quite good enough to follow it  it spoke in a
queer way  in starts—like a man whos out of breath  with no proper
expression  and of course it couldnt turn itself this way or that  the
way a—a real person—does ”

“did you understand any of what was said ”

“not very much  the fat man seemed to be introducing mark to it  it said
something to him  then mark tried to answer  i could follow him all
right  his french isnt much better than mine ”

“what did he say ”

“he said something about doing it in a few days if it was possible ”

“was that all ”

“very nearly  you see mark couldnt stand it  i knew he wouldnt be able
to  i remember  idiotically  in the dream  i wanted to tell him  i saw
he was going to fall  i think i tried to shout out to the other two 
hes going to fall  but  of course  i couldnt  he was sick too  then
they got him out of the room ”

all three were silent for a few seconds 

“was that all ” said miss ironwood 

“yes ” said jane  “thats all i remember  i think i woke up then ”

the director took a deep breath  “well ” he said  glancing at miss
ironwood  “it becomes plainer and plainer  we must hold a council at
once  is everyone here ”

“no  dr  dimble has had to go into edgestow  into college  to take
pupils  he wont be back till evening ”

“then we must hold the council this evening  make all arrangements ” he
paused for a moment and then turned to jane 

“i am afraid this is very bad for you  my dear ” he said  “and worse for
him ”

“you mean for mark  sir ”

“yes  dont think hardly of him  he is suffering  if we are defeated we
shall all go down with him  if we win we will rescue him  he cannot be
far gone yet ” he paused  smiled  and added  “we are quite used to
trouble about husbands here  you know  poor ivys is in jail ”

“in jail ”

“oh yes—for ordinary theft  but quite a good fellow  hell be all right
again ”

though jane had felt horror  even to the point of nausea  at the sight
 in her dream  of marks real surroundings and associates  it had been
horror that carried a certain grandeur and mystery with it  the sudden
equation between his predicament and that of a common convict whipped
the blood to her cheeks  she said nothing 

“one other thing ” continued the director  “you will not misunderstand
it if i exclude you from our council to-night ”

“of course not  sir ” said jane  in fact  misunderstanding it very much 

“you see ” he said  “macphee takes the line that if you hear things
talked of you will carry ideas of them into your sleep and that will
destroy the evidential value of your dreams  and its not very easy to
refute him  he is our sceptic  a very important office ”

“i quite understand ” said jane 

“that applies  of course ” said the director  “only to things we dont
know yet  you mustnt hear our guesses  you mustnt be there when were
puzzling over the evidence  but we have no secrets from you about the
earlier history of our family  in fact  macphee himself will insist on
being the one who tells you all that  hed be afraid graces account  or
mine  wouldnt be objective enough ”

“i see ”

“i want you to like him if you can  hes one of my oldest friends  and
hell be about our best man if were going to be defeated  you couldnt
have a better man at your side in a losing battle  what hell do if we
win  i cant imagine ”


                                   ii

mark woke next morning to the consciousness that his head ached all
over  but specially at the back  he remembered that he had fallen—that
was how he had hurt his head—fallen in that other room  with filostrato
and straik       and then  as one of the poets says  he “discovered in
his mind an inflammation swollen and deformed  his memory ” oh  but
impossible  not to be accepted for a moment  it had been a nightmare  it
must be shoved away  it would vanish away now that he was fully awake 
it was an absurdity  once in delirium he had seen the front part of a
horse  by itself  with no body or hind legs  running across a lawn  had
felt it ridiculous at the very moment of seeing it  but not the less
horrible for that  this was an absurdity of the same sort  a head
without any body underneath  a head that could speak when they turned on
the air and the artificial saliva with taps in the next room  his own
head began to throb so hard that he had to stop thinking 

but he knew it was true  and he could not  as they say  “take it ” he
was very ashamed of this  for he wished to be considered one of the
tough ones  but the truth is that his toughness was only of the will 
not of the nerves  and the virtues he had almost succeeded in banishing
from his mind still lived  if only negatively and as weaknesses  in his
body  he approved of vivisection  but had never worked in a dissecting
room  he recommended that certain classes of people should be gradually
eliminated  but he had never been there when a small shopkeeper went to
the workhouse or a starved old woman of the governess type came to the
very last day and hour and minute in the cold attic  he knew nothing
about the last half-cup of cocoa drunk slowly ten days before 

meantime he must get up  he must do something about jane  apparently he
would  have  to bring her to belbury  his mind had made this decision
for him at some moment he did not remember  he must get her  to save his
life  all his anxieties about being in the inner ring or getting a job
had shrunk into insignificance  it was a question of life or death  they
would kill him if he annoyed them  perhaps behead him       oh god  if
only they would really kill that monstrous little lump of torture  that
lump with a face  which they kept there talking on its steel bracket 
all the minor fears at belbury—for he knew now that all except the
leaders were always afraid—were only emanations from that central fear 
he must get jane  he wasnt fighting against that now 

it must be remembered that in marks mind hardly one rag of noble
thought  either christian or pagan  had a secure lodging  his education
had been neither scientific nor classical—merely “modern ” the
severities both of abstraction and of high human tradition had passed
him by  and he had neither peasant shrewdness nor aristocratic honour to
help him  he was a man of straw  a glib examinee in subjects that
require no exact knowledge  he had always done well on essays and
general papers  and the first hint of a real threat to his bodily life
knocked him sprawling  and his head ached so terribly and he felt so
sick  luckily he now kept a bottle of whisky in his room  a stiff one
enabled him to shave and dress 

he was late for breakfast but that made little difference for he could
not eat  he drank several cups of black coffee and then went into the
writing-room  here he sat for a long time drawing things on the
blotting-paper  this letter to jane proved almost impossible now that it
came to the point  and why did they want jane  formless fears stirred in
his mind  and jane of all people  would they take  her  to the head  for
almost the first time in his life a gleam of something like
disinterested love came into his mind  he wished he had never married
her  never dragged her into this whole outfit of horrors which was 
apparently  to be his life 

“hullo  studdock ” said a voice  “writing to little wifie  eh ”

“damn ” said mark  “youve made me drop my pen ”

“then pick it up  sonny ” said miss hardcastle  seating herself on the
table  mark did so  and then sat still  without looking up at her  not
since he had been bullied at school had he known what it was to hate and
dread anyone with every nerve of his body as he now hated and dreaded
this woman 

“ive got bad news for you  sonny ” she said presently  his heart gave a
jump 

“take it like a man  studdock ” said the fairy 

“what is it ”

she did not answer quite at once and he knew she was studying him 
watching how the instrument responded to her playing 

“im worried about little wifie  and thats a fact ” she said at last 

“what do you mean ” said mark sharply  this time looking up  the cheroot
between her teeth was still unlit  but she had got as far as taking out
her matches 

“i looked her up ” said miss hardcastle  “all on your account  too  i
thought edgestow wasnt too healthy a place for her to be at present ”

“whats wrong with her ” shouted mark 

“ssh ” said miss hardcastle  “you dont want everyone to hear ”

“cant you tell me whats wrong ”

she waited for a few seconds before replying  “how much do you know
about her family  studdock ”

“lots  whats that got to do with it ”

“nothing       queer       on either side ”

“what the devil do you mean ”

“dont be rude  honey  im doing all i can for you  its only—well  i
thought she was behaving pretty oddly when i saw her ”

mark well remembered his conversation with his wife on the morning he
left for belbury  a new stab of fear pierced him  might not this
detestable woman be speaking the truth 

“what did she say ” he asked 

“if there is anything wrong with her in that way ” said the fairy  “take
my advice  studdock  and have her over here at once  shell be properly
looked after here ”

“you havent yet told me what she said or did ”

“i wouldnt like to have anyone belonging to me popped into edgestow
asylum  specially now that were getting our emergency powers  theyll
be using the ordinary patients experimentally  you know  whereas if
youll just sign this form ill run over after lunch and have her here
this evening ”

“i shall do nothing of the sort  specially as you havent given me the
slightest notion whats wrong with her ”

“ive been trying to tell you but you dont let me  she kept on talking
about someone whod broken into your flat—or else met her at the station
 one couldnt make out which  and burned her with cigars  then  most
unfortunately  she noticed my cheroot  and  if you please  she
identified  me  with this imaginary persecutor  of course after that i
could do no good ”

“i must go home at once ” said mark  getting up 

“here—whoa  you cant do that ” said the fairy  also rising 

“cant go home  ive bloody well got to  if all this is true ”

“dont be a fool  lovey ” said miss hardcastle  “honest  i know what im
talking about  youre in a dam dangerous position already  youll about
do yourself in if youre absent without leave now  send me  sign the
form  thats the sensible way to do it ”

“but a moment ago you said she couldnt stand you at any price ”

“oh  that wouldnt make any odds  of course it would be easier if she
hadnt taken a dislike to me  i say  studdock  you dont think little
wifie could be jealous  do you ”

“jealous  of you ” said mark with uncontrollable disgust 

“where are you off to ” said the fairy sharply 

“to see the d d  and then home ”

“stop  you wont do that unless you mean to make me your enemy for
life—and let me tell you  you cant afford many more enemies ”

“oh  go to the devil ” said mark 

“come back  studdock ” shouted the fairy  “wait  dont be a bloody
fool ” but mark was already in the hall  for the moment everything
seemed to have become clear  he would look in on wither  not to ask for
leave but simply to announce that he had to go home at once because his
wife was dangerously ill  he would be out of the room before wither
could reply—and then off  the further future was vague  but that did not
seem to matter  he put on his hat and coat  ran upstairs and knocked at
the door of the deputy directors office 

there was no answer  then mark noticed that the door was not quite shut 
he ventured to push it open a little farther  and saw the deputy
director sitting inside with his back to the door  “excuse me  sir ”
said mark  “might i speak to you for a few minutes ” there was no
answer  “excuse me  sir ” said mark in a louder voice  but the figure
neither spoke nor moved  with some hesitation  mark went into the room
and walked round to the other side of the desk  but when he turned to
look at wither he caught his breath  for he thought he was looking into
the face of a corpse  a moment later he recognised his mistake  in the
stillness of the room he could hear the man breathing  he was not even
asleep  for his eyes were open  he was not unconscious  for his eyes
rested momentarily on mark and then looked away  “i beg your pardon 
sir ” began mark  and then stopped  the deputy director was not
listening  he was so far from listening that mark felt an insane doubt
whether he was there at all  whether the soul of the deputy director
were not floating far away  spreading and dissipating itself like a gas
through formless and lightless worlds  waste lands and lumber rooms of
the universe  what looked out of those pale watery eyes was  in a sense 
infinity—the shapeless and the interminable  the room was still and
cold  there was no clock and the fire had gone out  it was impossible to
speak to a face like that  yet it seemed impossible also to get out of
the room  for the man had seen him  mark was afraid  it was so unlike
any experience he had ever had before 

when at last mr  wither spoke  his eyes were not fixed on mark but on
some remote point beyond him  beyond the window  perhaps in the sky 

“i know who it is ” said wither  “your name is studdock  what do you
mean by coming here  you had better have stayed outside  go away ”

it was then that marks nerve suddenly broke  all the slowly mounting
fears of the last few days ran together into one fixed determination and
a few seconds later he was going downstairs three steps at a time  then
he was crossing the hall  then he was out  and walking down the drive 
once again  his immediate course seemed quite plain to him  opposite the
entrance was a thick belt of trees pierced by a field path  that path
would bring him in half an hour to courthampton and there he could get a
country bus to edgestow  about the future he did not think at all  only
two things mattered  firstly  to get out of that house  and secondly to
get back to jane  he was devoured with a longing for jane  which was
physical without being at all sensual  as if comfort and fortitude would
flow from her body  as if her very skin would clean away all the filth
that seemed to hang about him  the idea that she might be really mad had
somehow dropped out of his mind  and he was still young enough to be
incredulous of misery  he could not quite rid himself of the belief that
if only he made a dash for it the net must somehow break  the sky must
somehow clear  and it would all end up with jane and mark having tea
together as if none of all this had happened 

he was out of the grounds now  he was crossing the road  he had entered
the belt of trees  he stopped suddenly  something impossible was
happening  there was a figure before him on the path  a tall  very tall 
slightly stooping figure  sauntering and humming a little dreary tune 
the deputy director himself  and in one moment all that brittle
hardihood was gone from marks mood  he turned back  he stood in the
road  this seemed to him the worst pain that he had ever felt  then 
tired  so tired that he felt his legs would hardly carry him  he walked
very slowly back into belbury 


                                  iii

mr  macphee had a little room on the ground floor at the manor which he
called his office  and to which no woman was ever admitted except under
his own conduct  and in this tidy but dusty apartment he sat with jane
studdock shortly before dinner that evening  having invited her there to
give her what he called “a brief  objective outline of the situation ”

“i should premise at the outset  mrs  studdock ” he said  “that i have
known the director for a great many years and that for most of his life
he was a philologist  im not just satisfied myself that philology can
be regarded as an exact science  but i mention the fact as a testimony
to his general intellectual capacity  and  not to forejudge any issue  i
will not say  as i would in ordinary conversation  that he has always
been a man of what you might call an imaginative turn  his original name
was ransom ”

“not ransoms  dialect and semantics  ” said jane 

“aye  thats the man ” said macphee  “well  about six years ago—i have
all the dates in a wee book there  but it doesnt concern us at the
moment—came his first disappearance  he was clean gone—not a trace of
him—for about nine months  i thought hed most likely been drowned
bathing or something of the kind  and then one day what does he do but
turn up again in his rooms at cambridge and go down sick and into
hospital for three months more  and he wouldnt say where hed been
except privately to a few friends ”

“well ” said jane eagerly 

“he said ” answered macphee  producing his snuff-box and laying great
emphasis on the word  said   “he said hed been to the planet mars ”

“you mean he said this       while he was ill ”

“no  no  he says so still  make what you can of it  thats his story ”

“i believe it ” said jane 

macphee selected a pinch of snuff with as much care as if those
particular grains had differed from all the others in his box and spoke
before applying them to his nostrils 

“im giving you the facts ” he said  “he told us hed been to mars 
kidnapped  by professor weston and mr  devine—lord feverstone as he now
is  and by his own account hed escaped from them—on mars  youll
understand—and been wandering about there alone for a bit  alone ”

“its uninhabited  i suppose ”

“we have no evidence on that point except his own story  you are
doubtless aware  mrs  studdock  that a man in complete solitude even on
this earth—an explorer  for example—gets into very remarkable states of
consciousness  im told a man might forget his own identity ”

“you mean he might have imagined things on mars that werent there ”

“im making no comments ” said macphee  “im merely recording  by his
own accounts there are all kinds of creatures walking about there 
thats maybe why he has turned this house into a sort of menagerie  but
no matter for that  but he also says he met one kind of creature there
which specially concerns us at this moment  he called them eldils ”

“a kind of animal  do you mean ”

“did ever you try to define the word animal  mrs  studdock ”

“not that i remember  i meant  were these things       well 
intelligent  could they talk ”

“aye  they could talk  they were intelligent  forbye  which is not
always the same thing ”

“in fact these were the martians ”

“thats just what they werent  according to his account  they were on
mars  but they didnt rightly belong there  he says they are creatures
that live in empty space ”

“but theres no air ”

“im telling you his story  he says they dont breathe  he said also
that they dont reproduce their species and dont die  but youll
observe that even if we assume the rest of his story to be correct this
last statement could not rest on observation ”

“what on earth are they like ”

“im telling you how he described them ”

“i mean  what do they look like ”

“im not just exactly prepared to answer that question ” said macphee 

“are they perfectly  huge  ” said jane almost involuntarily 

macphee blew his nose and continued  “the point  mrs  studdock ” he
said  “is this  dr  ransom claims that he has received continual visits
from these creatures since he returned to earth  so much for his first
disappearance  then came the second  he was away for more than a year
and that time he said hed been in the planet venus—taken there by these
eldils ”

“venus is inhabited by them  too ”

“youll forgive me observing that this remark shows you have not grasped
what im telling you  these creatures are not planetary creatures at
all  supposing them to exist  you are to conceive them floating about
the depth of space  though they may alight on a planet here and there 
like a bird alighting on a tree  you understand  theres some of them 
he says  are more or less permanently attached to particular planets 
but theyre not native there  theyre just a clean different kind of
thing ”

there were a few seconds of silence  and then jane asked  “they are  i
gather  more or less friendly ”

“that is certainly the directors idea about them  with one important
exception “

“whats that ”

“the eldils that have for many centuries concentrated on our own planet 
we seem to have had no luck at all in choosing our particular complement
of parasites  and that  mrs  studdock  brings me to the point ”

jane waited  it was extraordinary how macphees manner almost
neutralised the strangeness of what he was telling her 

“the long and the short of it is ” said he  “that this house is
dominated either by the creatures im talking about  or by a sheer
delusion  it is by advices he thinks he has received from eldils that
the director has discovered the conspiracy against the human race  and
whats more  its on instructions from eldils that hes conducting the
campaign—if you can call it conducting  it may have occurred to you to
wonder  mrs  studdock  how any man in his senses thinks were going to
defeat a powerful conspiracy by sitting here growing winter vegetables
and training performing bears  it is a question i have propounded on
more than one occasion  the answer is always the same  were waiting for
orders ”

“from the eldils  it was them he meant when he spoke of his masters ”

“i doubt it would be  though he doesnt use that word in speaking to
me ”

“but  mr  macphee  i dont understand  i thought you said the ones on
our planet were hostile ”

“thats a very good question ” said macphee  “but its not our own ones
that the director claims to be in communication with  its his friends
from outer space  our own crew  the terrestrial eldils  are at the back
of the whole conspiracy  you are to imagine us  mrs  studdock  living on
a world where the criminal classes of the eldils have established their
headquarters  and whats happening now  if the directors views are
correct  is that their own respectable kith and kin are visiting this
planet to red the place up ”

“you mean that the other eldils  out of space  actually come here—to
this house ”

“that is what the director thinks ”

“but you must know whether its true or not ”

“how ”

“have you seen them ”

“thats not a question to be answered aye or no  ive seen a good many
things in my time that werent there or werent what they pretended to
be  rainbows and reflections and sunsets  not to mention dreams  and
theres hetero-suggestion too  i will not deny that i have observed a
class of phenomena in this house that i have not yet fully accounted
for  but they never occurred at a moment when i had a note-book handy or
any facilities for verification ”

“isnt seeing believing ”

“it may be—for children or beasts ” said macphee 

“but not for sensible people  you mean ”

“my uncle  dr  duncanson ” said macphee  “whose name may be familiar to
you—he was moderator of the general assembly over the water  in
scotland—used to say  show it me in the word of god  and then hed
slap down the big bible on the table  it was a way he had of shutting up
people that came to him blathering about religious experiences  and
granting his premises  he was quite right  i dont hold his views  mrs 
studdock  you understand  but i work on the same principles  if anything
wants andrew macphee to believe in its existence  ill be obliged if it
will present itself in full daylight  with a sufficient number of
witnesses present  and not get shy if you hold up a camera or a
thermometer ”

“you have seen something  then ”

“aye  but we must keep an open mind  it might be a hallucination  it
might be a conjuring trick      ”

“by the director ” asked jane angrily  mr  macphee once more had
recourse to his snuff-box  “do you really expect me ” said jane  “to
believe that the director is that sort of man  a charlatan ”

“i wish  maam ” said macphee  “you could see your way to consider the
matter without constantly using such terms as  believe   obviously 
conjuring is one of the hypotheses that any impartial investigator must
take into account  the fact that it is a hypothesis specially
uncongenial to the emotions of this investigator or that  is neither
here nor there  unless  maybe  it is an extra ground for emphasising the
hypothesis in question  just because there is a strong psychological
danger of neglecting it ”

“theres such a thing as loyalty ” said jane 

macphee  who had been carefully shutting up the snuff-box  suddenly
looked up with a hundred covenanters in his eyes 

“there is  maam ” he said  “as you get older you will learn that it is
a virtue too important to be lavished on individual personalities ”

at that moment there was a knock at the door  “come in ” said macphee 
and camilla entered 

“have you finished with jane  mr  macphee ” she said  “she promised to
come out for a breath of air with me before dinner ”

“och  breath of air your grandmother ” said macphee with a gesture of
despair  “very well  ladies  very well  away out to the garden  i doubt
theyre doing something more to the purpose on the enemys side  theyll
have all this country under their hands before we move  at this rate ”

“i wish youd read the poem im reading ” said camilla  “for it says in
one line just what i feel about this waiting 

                           fool  
   all lies in a passion of patience  my lords rule ” 

“whats that from ” asked jane 

“ taliessin through logres  ”

“mr  macphee probably approves of no poets except burns ”

“burns ” said macphee with profound contempt  opening the drawer of his
table with great energy and producing a formidable sheaf of papers  “if
youre going to the garden  dont let me delay you  ladies ”

“hes been telling you ” said camilla  as the two girls went together
down the passage  moved by a kind of impulse which was rare to her
experience  jane seized her friends hand as she answered “yes ” both
were filled with some passion  but what passion they did not know  they
came to the front door  and as they opened it a sight met their eyes
which  though natural  seemed at the moment apocalyptic 

all day the wind had been rising and they found themselves looking out
on a sky swept almost clean  the air was intensely cold  the stars
severe and bright  high above the last rags of scurrying cloud hung the
moon in all her wildness—not the voluptuous moon of a thousand southern
love-songs  but the huntress  the untameable virgin  the spear-head of
madness  if that cold satellite had just then joined our planet for the
first time  it could hardly have looked more like an omen  the wildness
crept into janes blood 

“that mr  macphee      ” said jane  as they walked steeply uphill to the
very summit of the garden 

“i know ” said camilla  and then  “ you  believed it ”

“of course ”

“how does mr  macphee explain the directors age ”

“you mean his looking—or being—so young—if you call it young ”

“yes  that is what people are like who come back from the stars  or at
least from perelandra  paradise is still going on there  make him tell
you about it some time  he will never grow a year or a month older
again ”

“will he die ”

“he will be taken away  i believe  back into deep heaven  it has
happened to one or two people  perhaps about six  since the world
began ”

“camilla ”

“yes ”

“what—what  is  he ”

“hes a man  my dear  and he is the pendragon of logres  this house  all
of us here  and mr  bultitude and pinch  are all thats left of logres 
all the rest has become merely britain  go on  lets go right to the
top  how its blowing  they might come to him to-night ”


                                   iv

that evening jane washed up under the attentive eye of baron corvo  the
jackdaw  while the others held council in the blue room 

“well ” said ransom  as grace ironwood concluded reading from her notes 
“that is the dream  and everything in it seems to be objective ”

“objective ” said dimble  “i dont understand  sir  you dont mean they
could really have a thing like that ”

“what do you think  macphee ” asked ransom 

“oh aye  its possible ” said macphee  “you see its an old experiment
with animals heads  they do it often in laboratories  you cut off a
cats head  maybe  and throw the body away  you can keep the head going
for a bit if you supply it with blood at the right pressure ”

“fancy ” said ivy maggs 

“do you mean  keep it  alive  ” said dimble 

“ alive  is an ambiguous word  you can keep all the functions  its what
would be popularly called alive  but a human head—and consciousness—i
dont know what would happen if you tried that ”

“it has been tried ” said miss ironwood  “a german tried it before the
first war  with the head of a criminal ”

“is that a fact ” said macphee with great interest  “and do you know
what result he got ”

“it failed  the head simply decayed in the ordinary way ”

“ive had enough of this  i have ” said ivy maggs  rising and abruptly
leaving the room 

“then this filthy abomination ” said dr  dimble  “is real—not only a
dream ” his face was white and his expression strained  his wifes face 
on the other hand  showed nothing more than that controlled distaste
with which a lady of the old school listens to any disgusting detail
when its mention becomes unavoidable 

“we have no evidence of that ” said macphee  “im only stating the
facts  what the girl has dreamed is possible ”

“and what about this turban business ” said denniston  “this sort of
swelling on top of the head ”

“you see what it  might  be ” said the director 

“im not sure that i do  sir ” said dimble 

“supposing the dream to be veridical ” said macphee  “you can guess what
it would be  once theyd got it kept alive  the first thing that would
occur to boys like them would be to increase its brain  theyd try all
sorts of stimulants  and then  maybe  theyd ease open the skull-cap and
just—well  just let it boil over  as you might say  thats the idea  i
dont doubt  a cerebral hypertrophy artificially induced to support a
superhuman power of ideation ”

“is it at all probable ” said the director  “that a hypertrophy like
that would increase thinking power ”

“that seems to me the weak point ” said miss ironwood  “i should have
thought it was just as likely to produce lunacy—or nothing at all  but
it  might  have the opposite effect ”

“then what we are up against ” said dimble  “is a criminals brain
swollen to superhuman proportions and experiencing a mode of
consciousness which we cant imagine  but which is presumably a
consciousness of agony and hatred ”

“its not certain ” said miss ironwood  “that there would be very much
actual pain  some from the neck  perhaps  at first ”

“what concerns us much more immediately ” said macphee  “is to determine
what conclusions we can draw from these carryings-on with alcasans head
and what practical steps should be taken on our part—always  and simply
as a working hypothesis  assuming the dream to be veridical ”

“it tells us one thing straightaway ” said denniston 

“whats that ” asked macphee 

“that the enemy movement is international  to get that head they must
have been hand-in-glove with at least one foreign police force ”

macphee rubbed his hands  “man ” he said  “you have the makings of a
logical thinker  but the deductions not all that certain  bribery might
account for it without actual consolidation ”

“it tells us something in the long run even more important ” said the
director  “it means that if this technique is really successful  the
belbury people have for all practical purposes discovered a way of
making themselves immortal ” there was a moments silence  and then he
continued  “it is the beginning of what is really a new species—the
chosen heads who never die  they will call it the next step in
evolution  and henceforward all the creatures that you and i call human
are mere candidates for admission to the new species or else its
slaves—perhaps its food ”

“the emergence of the bodiless men ” said dimble 

“very likely  very likely ” said macphee  extending his snuff-box to the
last speaker  it was refused  and he took a very deliberate pinch before
proceeding  “but theres no good at all applying the forces of rhetoric
to make ourselves skeery or daffing our own heads off our shoulders
because some other fellows have had the shoulders taken from under their
heads  ill back the directors head  and yours dr  dimble  and my own 
against this lads whether the brains is boiling out of it or no 
provided we use them  i should be glad to hear what practical measures
on our side are suggested ”

with these words he tapped his knuckles gently on his knee and stared
hard at the director 

“it is ” said macphee  “a question i have ventured to propound before ”

a sudden transformation  like the leaping up of a flame in embers 
passed over grace ironwoods face  “can the director not be trusted to
produce his own plan in his own time  mr  macphee ” she said fiercely 

“by the same token  doctor ” said he  “can the directors council not be
trusted to hear his plan ”

“what do you mean  macphee ” asked dimble 

“mr  director ” said macphee  “youll excuse me for speaking frankly 
your enemies have provided themselves with this head  they have taken
possession of edgestow  and theyre in a fair way to suspend the laws of
england  and still you tell us it is not time to move  if you had taken
my advice six months ago we would have had an organisation all over this
island by now and maybe a party in the house of commons  i know well
what youll say—that those are not the right methods  and maybe no  but
if you can neither take our advice nor give us anything to do  what are
we all sitting here for  have you seriously considered sending us away
and getting some other colleagues that you  can  work with ”

“dissolve the company  do you mean ” said dimble 

“aye  i do ” said macphee 

the director looked up with a smile  “but ” he said  “i have no power to
dissolve it ”

“in that case ” said macphee  “i must ask what authority you had to
bring it together ”

“i never brought it together ” said the director  then  after glancing
round the company  he added  “there is some strange misunderstanding
here  were you all under the impression i had  selected  you ”

“were you ” he repeated  when no one answered 

“well ” said dimble  “as regards myself i fully realise that the thing
has come about more or less unconsciously—even accidentally  there was
no moment at which you asked me to join a definite movement  or anything
of that kind  that is why i have always regarded myself as a sort of
camp follower  i had assumed that the others were in a more regular
position ”

“you know why camilla and i are here  sir ” said denniston  “we
certainly didnt intend or foresee how we were going to be employed ”

grace ironwood looked up with a set expression on her face  which had
grown rather pale  “do you wish        ” she began 

the director laid his hand on her arm  “no ” he said  “no  there is no
need for all these stories to be told ”

macphees stern features relaxed into a broad grin  “i see what youre
driving at ” he said  “weve all been playing blind-mans buff  i doubt 
but ill take leave to observe  dr  ransom  that you carry things a wee
bit high  i dont just remember how you came to be called director  but
from that title and from one or two other indications a man would have
thought you behaved more like the leader of an organisation than the
host at a house-party ”

“i am the director ” said ransom  smiling  “do you think i would claim
the authority i do if the relation between us depended either on your
choice or mine  you never chose me  i never chose you  even the great
oyéresu whom i serve never chose me  i came into their worlds by what
seemed  at first  a chance  as you came to me—as the very animals in
this house first came to it  you and i have not started or devised this 
it has descended on us—sucked us into itself  if you like  it is  no
doubt  an organisation  but we are not the organisers  and that is why i
have no authority to give any one of you permission to leave my
household ”

for a time there was complete silence in the blue room  except for the
crackling of the fire 

“if there is nothing more to discuss ” said grace ironwood presently 
“perhaps we had better leave the director to rest ”

macphee rose and dusted some snuff off the baggy knees of his
trousers—thus preparing a wholly novel adventure for the mice when they
next came out in obedience to the directors whistle 

“i have no notion ” he said  “of leaving this house if anyone wishes me
to stay  but as regards the general hypothesis on which the director
appears to be acting and the very peculiar authority he claims  i
absolutely reserve my judgement  you know well  mr  director  in what
sense i have  and in what sense i have not  complete confidence in
yourself ”

the director laughed  “heaven forbid ” he said  “that i should claim to
know what goes on in the two halves of your head  macphee  much less how
you connect them  but i know—what matters much more—the kind of
confidence i have in you  but wont you sit down  there is much more to
be said ”

macphee resumed his chair  grace ironwood  who had been sitting bolt
upright in hers  relaxed  and the director spoke 

“we have learned to-night ” he said  “if not what the real power behind
our enemies is doing  at least the form in which it is embodied at
belbury  we therefore know something about one of the two attacks which
are about to be made on our race  but im thinking of the other ”

“yes ” said camilla earnestly  “the other ”

“meaning by that ” asked macphee 

“meaning ” said ransom  “whatever is under bragdon wood ”

“youre still thinking about  that  ” said the ulsterman 

“i am thinking of almost nothing else ” said the director  “we knew
already that the enemy wanted the wood  some of us guessed why  now jane
has seen—or rather felt—in a vision what it is they are looking for in
bragdon  it may be the greater danger of the two  but what is certain is
that the greatest danger of all is the junction of the enemies forces 
he is staking everything on that  when the new power from belbury joins
up with the old power under bragdon wood  logres—indeed man—will be
almost surrounded  for us everything turns on preventing that junction 
that is the point at which we must be ready both to kill and die  but we
cannot strike yet  we cannot get into bragdon and start excavating for
ourselves  there must be a moment when they find him—it  i have no doubt
we shall be told in one way or another  till then we must wait ”

“i dont believe a word of all that other story ” said macphee 

“i thought ” said miss ironwood  “we werent to use words like
 believe   i thought we were only to state facts and exhibit
implications ”

“if you two quarrel much more ” said the director  “i think ill make
you marry one another ”


                                   v

at the beginning the grand mystery for the company had been why the
enemy wanted bragdon wood  the land was unsuitable and could be made fit
to bear a building on the scale they proposed only by the costliest
preliminary work  and edgestow itself was not an obviously convenient
place  by intense study in collaboration with dr  dimble and despite the
continued scepticism of macphee the director had at last come to a
certain conclusion  dimble and he and the dennistons shared between them
a knowledge of arthurian britain which orthodox scholarship will
probably not reach for some centuries  they knew that edgestow lay in
what had been the very heart of ancient logres  that the village of cure
hardy preserved the name of ozana le cœur hardi  and that a historical
merlin had once worked in what was now bragdon wood 

what exactly he had done there they did not know  but they had all  by
various routes  come too far either to consider his art mere legend and
imposture  or to equate it exactly with what the renaissance called
magic  dimble even maintained that a good critic  by his sensibility
alone  could detect the difference between the traces which the two
things had left on literature  “what common measure is there ” he would
ask  “between ceremonial occultists like faustus and prospero and
archimago with their midnight studies  their forbidden books  their
attendant fiends or elementals  and a figure like merlin who seems to
produce his results simply by being merlin ” and ransom agreed  he
thought that merlins art was the last survival of something older and
different—something brought to western europe after the fall of numinor
and going back to an era in which the general relations of mind and
matter on this planet had been other than those we know  it had probably
differed from renaissance magic profoundly  it had possibly  though this
was doubtful  been less guilty  it had certainly been more effective 
for paracelsus and agrippa and the rest had achieved little or nothing 
bacon himself—no enemy to magic except on this account—reported that the
magicians “attained not to greatness and certainty of works ” the whole
renaissance outburst of forbidden arts had  it seemed  been a method of
losing ones soul on singularly unfavourable terms  but the older art
had been a different proposition 

but if the only possible attraction of bragdon lay in its association
with the last vestiges of atlantean magic  this told the company
something else  it told them that the n i c e   at its core  was not
concerned solely with modern or materialistic forms of power  it told
the director  in fact  that there was eldilic energy and eldilic
knowledge behind it  it was  of course  another question whether its
human members knew of the dark powers who were their real organisers 
and in the long run this question was not perhaps important  as ransom
himself had said more than once  “whether they know it or whether they
dont  much the same sort of things are going to happen  its not a
question of how the belbury people are going to act—the dark-eldils will
see to that—but of how they will think about their actions  theyll go
to bragdon  it remains to be seen whether any of them will know the real
reason why theyre going there  or whether theyll all fudge up some
theory of soils  or air  or etheric tensions  to explain it ”

up to a certain point the director had supposed that the powers for
which the enemy hankered were resident in the mere site at bragdon—for
there is an old and widespread belief that locality itself is of
importance in such matters  but from janes dream of the cold sleeper he
had learned better  it was something much more definite  something
located under the soil of bragdon wood  something to be discovered by
digging  it was  in fact  the body of merlin  what the eldils had told
him about the possibility of such discovery he had received  while they
were with him  almost without wonder  it was no wonder to them  in their
eyes the normal tellurian modes of being—engendering and birth and death
and decay—which are to us the framework of thought  were no less
wonderful than the countless other patterns of being which were
continually present to their unsleeping minds  to those high creatures
whose activity builds what we call nature  nothing is “natural ” from
their station the essential arbitrariness  so to call it  of every
actual creation is ceaselessly visible  for them there are no basic
assumptions  all springs with the wilful beauty of a jest or a tune from
that miraculous moment of self-limitation wherein the infinite 
rejecting a myriad possibilities  throws out of himself the positive and
elected invention  that a body should lie uncorrupted for fifteen
hundred years  did not seem strange to them  they knew worlds where
there was no corruption at all  that its individual life should remain
latent in it all that time  was to them no more strange  they had seen
innumerable different modes in which soul and matter could be combined
and separated  separated without loss of reciprocal influence  combined
without true incarnation  fused so utterly as to be a third thing  or
periodically brought together in a union as short  and as momentous  as
the nuptial embrace  it was not as a marvel in natural philosophy  but
as an information in time of war that they brought the director their
tidings  merlin had not died  his life had been hidden  side-tracked 
moved out of our one-dimensioned time  for fifteen centuries  but under
certain conditions it would return to his body 

they had not told him this till recently because they had not known it 
one of ransoms greatest difficulties in disputing with macphee  who
consistently professed to disbelieve the very existence of the eldils 
was that macphee made the common  but curious assumption that if there
are creatures wiser and stronger than man they must be forthwith
omniscient and omnipotent  in vain did ransom endeavour to explain the
truth  doubtless the great beings who now so often came to him had power
sufficient to sweep belbury from the face of england and england from
the face of the globe  perhaps to blot the globe itself out of
existence  but no power of that kind would be used  nor had they any
direct vision into the minds of men  it was in a different place  and
approaching their knowledge from the other side  that they had
discovered the state of merlin  not from inspection of the thing that
slept under bragdon wood  but from observing a certain unique
configuration in that place where those things remain that are taken off
times mainroad  behind the invisible hedges  into the unimaginable
fields  not all the times that are outside the present are therefore
past or future 

it was this that kept the director wakeful  with knitted brow  in the
small cold hours of that morning when the others had left him  there was
no doubt in his mind now that the enemy had bought bragdon to find
merlin  and if they found him they would re-awake him  the old druid
would inevitably cast in his lot with the new planners—what could
prevent his doing so  a junction would be effected between two kinds of
power which between them would determine the fate of our planet 
doubtless that had been the will of the dark-eldils for centuries  the
physical sciences  good and innocent in themselves  had already  even in
ransoms own time  begun to be warped  had been subtly manœuvred in a
certain direction  despair of objective truth had been increasingly
insinuated into the scientists  indifference to it  and a concentration
upon mere power  had been the result  babble about the  élan vital  and
flirtations with pan-psychism were bidding fair to restore the  anima
mundi  of the magicians  dreams of the far future destiny of man were
dragging up from its shallow and unquiet grave the old dream of man as
god  the very experiences of the dissecting-room and the pathological
laboratory were breeding a conviction that the stifling of all deep-set
repugnances was the first essential for progress  and now all this had
reached the stage at which its dark contrivers thought they could safely
begin to bend it back so that it would meet that other and earlier kind
of power  indeed  they were choosing the first moment at which this
could have been done  you could not have done it with nineteenth-century
scientists  their firm objective materialism would have excluded it from
their minds  and even if they could have been made to believe  their
inherited morality would have kept them from touching dirt  macphee was
a survivor from that tradition  it was different now  perhaps few or
none of the people at belbury knew what was happening  but once it
happened  they would be like straw in fire  what should they find
incredible  since they believed no longer in a rational universe  what
should they regard as too obscene  since they held that all morality was
a mere subjective by-product of the physical and economic situations of
men  the time was ripe  from the point of view which is accepted in
hell  the whole history of our earth had led up to this moment  there
was now at last a real chance for fallen man to shake off that
limitation of his powers which mercy had imposed upon him as a
protection from the full results of his fall  if this succeeded  hell
would be at last incarnate  bad men  while still in the body  still
crawling on this little globe  would enter that state which  heretofore 
they had entered only after death  would have the diuturnity and power
of evil spirits  nature  all over the globe of tellus  would become
their slave  and of that dominion no end  before the end of time itself 
could be certainly foreseen

up till now  whatever his days had been like  mark had usually slept
well  this night  sleep failed him  he had not written to jane  he had
spent the day keeping out of sight and doing nothing in particular  the
wakeful night moved all his fears on to a new level  he was  of course 
a materialist in theory  and  also in theory  he was past the age at
which one can have night fears  but now  as the wind rattled his window
hour after hour  he felt the nursery terrors again  the old exquisite
thrill  as of cold fingers delicately travelling down his back 
materialism is in fact no protection  those who seek it in that hope
 they are not a negligible class  will be disappointed  the thing you
fear is impossible  well and good  can you therefore cease to fear it 
not here and now  and what then  if you must see ghosts it is better not
to disbelieve in them 

he was called earlier than usual  and with his tea came a note  the
deputy director sent his compliments and must ask mr  studdock to call
on him  instantly  about a most urgent and distressing matter  mark
dressed and obeyed 

in withers room he found wither and miss hardcastle  to marks surprise
and  momentarily  to his relief wither showed no recollection of their
last meeting  indeed  his manner was genial  even deferential  though
extremely grave 

“good morning  good morning  mr  studdock ” he said  “it is with the
greatest regret that i—er—in short  i would not have kept you from your
breakfast unless i had felt that in your own interests you should be
placed in full possession of the facts at the earliest possible moment 
you will of course regard all that i am about to say as strictly
confidential  the matter is a distressing or at least an embarrassing
one  i feel sure that as the conversation proceeds  pray be seated  mr 
studdock  you will realise in your present situation how very wise we
have been in securing from the outset a police force—to give it that
rather unfortunate name—of our own ”

mark licked his lips and sat down 

“my reluctance to raise the question ” continued wither  “would 
however  be very much more serious if i did not feel able to assure
you—in  advance  you understand—of the complete confidence which we all
feel in you and which i very much hoped”  here for the first time he
looked mark in the eyes  “you were beginning to reciprocate  we regard
ourselves here as being so many brothers and—er—sisters  so that
whatever passes between us in this room can be regarded as confidential
in the fullest possible sense of the word  and i take it we shall all
feel entitled to discuss the subject i am about to mention in the most
human and informal manner possible ”

miss hardcastles voice  suddenly breaking in  had an effect not wholly
unlike that of a pistol shot 

“you have lost your wallet  studdock ” she said 

“my—my wallet ” said mark 

“yes  wallet  pocket-book  thing you keep notes and letters in ”

“yes  i have  have you found it ”

“does it contain three pounds ten  counterfoil of postal order for five
shillings  letters from a woman signing herself myrtle  from the bursar
of bracton  from g  hernshaw  f  a  browne  m  belcher  and a bill for a
dress-suit from simonds and son  32a market street  edgestow ”

“well  more or less so ”

“there it is ” said miss hardcastle pointing to the table  “no you
dont ” she added as mark made a step towards it 

“what on earth is all this about ” said mark  his tone was that which i
think almost any man would have used in the circumstances but which
policemen are apt to describe as “blustering ”

“none of that ” said miss hardcastle  “this wallet was found in the
grass beside the road about five yards away from hingests body ”

“my god ” said studdock  “you dont mean       the things absurd ”

“theres no use appealing to  me  ” said miss hardcastle  “im not a
solicitor  nor a jury  nor a judge  im only a policewoman  im telling
you the facts ”

“do i understand that im suspected of murdering hingest ”

“i dont really think ” said the deputy director  “that you need have
the slightest apprehension that there is  at this stage  any radical
difference between your colleagues and yourself as to the light in which
this very painful matter should be regarded  the question is really a
constitutional one——”

“constitutional ” said mark angrily  “if i understand her  miss
hardcastle is accusing me of murder ”

withers eyes looked at him as if from an infinite distance 

“oh ” said he  “i dont really think that does justice to miss
hardcastles position  that element in the institute which she
represents would be strictly  ultra vires  in doing anything of the kind
within the n i c e —supposing  but purely of course for purposes of
argument  that they wished  or should wish at a later stage  to do
so—while in relation to the outside authorities their function  however
we define it  would be quite inconsistent with any action of the sort 
at least in the sense in which i understand you to be using the words ”

“but its the outside authorities with whom im concerned  i suppose ”
said mark  his mouth had become dry and he had difficulty in making
himself audible  “as far as i can understand  miss hardcastle means im
going to be arrested ”

“on the contrary ” said wither  “this is precisely one of those cases in
which you see the enormous value of possessing our own executive  here
is a matter which might  i fear  cause you very considerable
inconvenience if the ordinary police had discovered the wallet or if we
were in the position of an ordinary citizen who felt it his duty—as we
should ourselves feel it our duty if we ever came to be in that very
different situation—to hand over the wallet to them  i do not know if
miss hardcastle has made it perfectly clear to you that it was her
officers  and they only  who have made this—er—embarrassing discovery ”

“what on earth do you mean ” said mark  “if miss hardcastle does not
think theres a prima facie case against me  why am i being arraigned in
this way at all  and if she does  how can she avoid informing the
authorities ”

“my dear friend ” said wither in an antediluvian tone  “there is not the
slightest desire on the part of the committee to insist on defining  in
cases of this sort  the powers of action of our own police  much less 
what is here in question  their powers of inaction  i do not think
anyone had suggested that miss hardcastle should be  obliged —in any
sense that limited her own initiative—to communicate to outside
authorities  who by their very organisation must be supposed to be less
adapted for dealing with such imponderable and quasi-technical inquiries
as will often arise  any facts acquired by her and her staff in the
course of their internal functioning within the n i c e ”

“do i understand ” said mark  “that miss hardcastle thinks she has facts
justifying my arrest for the murder of mr  hingest  but is kindly
offering to suppress them ”

“you got it now  studdock ” said the fairy  a moment later  for the
first time in marks experience  she actually lit her cheroot  blew a
cloud of smoke  and smiled  or at least drew back her lips so that the
teeth became visible 

“but thats not what i want ” said mark  this was not quite true  the
idea of having the thing hushed up in any way and on almost any terms
when it first presented itself a few seconds ago had come like air to
one suffocating  but something like citizenship was still alive in him
and he proceeded  almost without noticing this emotion  to follow a
different line  “i dont want that ” he said  speaking rather too loud 
“im an innocent man  i think id better go to the police—the  real 
police  i mean—at once ”

“if you  want  to be tried for your life ” said the fairy  “thats
another matter ”

“i want to be vindicated ” said mark  “the charge would fall to pieces
at once  there was no conceivable motive  and i have an alibi  everyone
knows i slept here that night ”

“really ” said the fairy 

“what do you mean ” said mark 

“theres always a  motive   you know ” said she  “for anyone murdering
anyone  the police are only human  when the machinerys started they
naturally want a conviction ”

mark assured himself he was not frightened  if only wither didnt keep
all his windows shut and then have a roaring fire 

“theres a letter you wrote ” said the fairy 

“what letter ”

“a letter to a mr  pelham  of your own college  dated six weeks ago  in
which you say  i wish bill the blizzard could be moved to a better
world ”

like a sharp physical pain the memory of that scribbled note came back
to mark  it was the sort of silly jocularity one used in the progressive
element—the kind of thing that might be said a dozen times a day in
bracton about an opponent or even about a bore 

“how does that letter come to be in your hands ” said mark 

“i think  mr  studdock ” said the deputy director  “it would be very
improper to suggest that miss hardcastle should give any kind of
exposition—in detail  i mean—of the actual working of the institutional
police  in saying this i do not mean for one moment to deny that the
fullest possible confidence between all the members of the n i c e  is
one of the most valuable characteristics it can have  and  indeed  a
 sine qua non  of that really concrete and organic life which we expect
it to develop  but there are necessarily certain spheres—not sharply
defined  of course  but inevitably revealing themselves in response to
the environment and obedience to the indwelling  ethos  or dialectic of
the whole—in which a confidence that involved the verbal interchange of
 facts  would—er—would defeat its own end ”

“you dont suppose ” said mark  “that anyone could take that letter to
be meant seriously ”

“ever tried to make a policeman understand anything ” said the fairy  “i
mean what you call a  real  policeman ”

mark said nothing 

“and i dont think the alibi is specially good ” said the fairy  “you
were seen talking to bill at dinner  you were seen going out of the
front door with him when he left  you were not seen coming back  nothing
is known of your movements till breakfast-time next morning  if you had
gone with him by car to the scene of the murder you would have had ample
time to walk back and go to bed by about 2 15  frosty night  you know 
no reason why your shoes should have been specially muddy or anything of
that sort ”

“if i might pick up a point made by miss hardcastle ” said wither  “this
is a very good illustration of the immense importance of the
institutional police  there are so many fine shades involved which it
would be unreasonable to expect the ordinary authorities to understand
but which  so long as they remain  so to speak  in our own family circle
 i look upon the n i c e   mr  studdock  as one great family  need
develop no tendency to lead to any miscarriage of justice ”

owing to some mental confusion which had before now assailed him in
dentists operating-rooms and in the studies of headmasters  mark began
almost to identify the situation which seemed to be imprisoning him with
his literal imprisonment by the four walls of that hot room  if only he
could once get out of it  on any terms  out into the free air and
sunlight  away over the countryside  away from the recurrent creak of
the deputy directors collar and the red stains on the end of miss
hardcastles cheroot and the picture of the king which hung above the
fireplace 

“you really advise me  sir ” he said  “not to go to the police ”

“to the police ” said wither as if this idea were completely new  “i
dont think  mr  studdock  that anyone had quite contemplated your
taking any irrevocable action of that sort  it might even be argued that
by such an action you would be guilty—unintentionally guilty  i hasten
to add—of some degree of disloyalty to your colleagues and specially to
miss hardcastle  you would  of course  be placing yourself outside our
protection       ”

“thats the point  studdock ” said the fairy  “once you are in the hands
of the police you are in the hands of the police ”

the moment of marks decision had passed by him without his noticing it 

“well ” he said  “what do you propose to do ”

“me ” said the fairy  “sit tight  its lucky for you that it was we and
not some outsider who found the wallet ”

“not only fortunate for—er—mr  studdock ” added wither gently  “but for
the whole n i c e  we could not have been indifferent     ”

“theres only one snag ” said the fairy  “and that is that we havent
got your letter to pelham  only a copy  but with any luck  nothing will
come of that ”

“then theres nothing to be done at present ” said mark 

“no ” said wither  “no  no immediate action of any official character 
it is  of course  very advisable that you should act  as i am sure you
will  with the greatest prudence and—er—er—caution for the next few
months  as long as you are with us  scotland yard would  i feel  see the
inconvenience of trying to act unless they had a very clear case indeed 
it is no doubt probable that some—er—some trial of strength between the
ordinary executive and our own organisation will take place within the
next six months  but i think it very unlikely they would choose to make
this a test case ”

“but do you mean they suspect me already ” said mark 

“well hope not ” said the fairy  “of course they want a prisoner—thats
only natural  but theyd a damn sight rather have one who doesnt
involve them in searching the premises of the n i c e ”

“but  look here  damn it ” said mark  “arent you hoping to catch the
thief in a day or two  arent you going to do  anything  ”

“the thief ” said wither  “there has been no suggestion so far that the
body was rifled ”

“i mean the thief who stole my wallet ”

“oh—ah—your wallet ” said the other  very gently stroking his refined 
handsome face  “i see  i understand  do i  that you are advancing a
charge of theft against some person or persons unknown——”

“but  good god ” shouted mark  “were you not assuming that someone stole
it  do you think i was there myself  do  you  both think i am a
murderer ”

“please ” said the deputy director  “please  mr  studdock  you really
must not shout  quite apart from the indiscretion of it  i must remind
you that you are in the presence of a lady  as far as i can remember 
nothing has been said on our side about murder  and no charge of any
sort had been made  my only anxiety is to make perfectly clear what we
are all doing  there are  of course  certain lines of conduct and a
certain mode of procedure which it would be theoretically possible for
you to adopt and which would make it very difficult for us to continue
the discussion  i am sure miss hardcastle agrees with me ”

“its all one to me ” said the fairy  “why studdock should start
bellowing at us because we are trying to keep him out of the dock  i
dont know  but thats for him to decide  ive got a busy day and dont
want to hang about here all morning ”

“really ” said mark  “i should have thought it was excusable to——”

“pray compose yourself  mr  studdock ” said wither  “as i said before 
we look upon ourselves as one family and nothing like a formal apology
is required  we all understand one another and all dislike—er—scenes  i
might perhaps be allowed to mention  in the friendliest possible manner 
that any instability of temperament would be viewed by the committee
as—well  as not very favourable to the confirmation of your appointment 
we are all speaking  of course  in the strictest confidence ”

mark was far past bothering about the job for its own sake  but he
realised that the threat of dismissal was now a threat of hanging 

“im sorry if i was rude ” he said at last  “what do you advise me to
do ”

“dont put your nose outside belbury  studdock ” said the fairy 

“i do not think miss hardcastle could have given you better advice ”
said wither  “and now that mrs  studdock is going to join you here this
temporary captivity—i am using that word  you will understand  in a
metaphorical sense—will not be a serious hardship  you must look upon
this as your  home   mr  studdock ”

“oh       that reminds me  sir ” said mark  “im not really quite sure
about having my wife here  as a matter of fact shes not in very good
health——”

“but surely  in that case  you must be all the more anxious to have her
here ”

“i dont believe it would suit her  sir ”

the d d s eyes wandered and his voice became lower 

“i had almost forgotten  mr  studdock ” he said  “to congratulate you on
your introduction to our head  it marks an important transition in your
career  we all now feel that you are really one of us in a deeper sense 
i am sure nothing is further from your intention than to repell the
friendly—the almost fatherly—concern he feels about you  he is very
anxious to welcome mrs  studdock among us at the earliest opportunity ”

“why ” said mark suddenly 

wither looked at mark with an indescribable smile 

“my dear boy ” he said  “unity  you know  the family circle  shed—shed
be company for miss hardcastle ” before mark had recovered from this
staggeringly new conception  wither rose and shuffled towards the door 
he paused with one hand on the handle and laid the other on marks
shoulder 

“you must be hungry for your breakfast ” he said  “dont let me delay
you  behave with the greatest caution  and—and”—here his face suddenly
changed  the widely opened mouth looked all at once like the mouth of
some enraged animal  what had been the senile vagueness of the eyes
became an absence of all specifically human expression  “and bring the
girl  do you understand  get your wife ” he added  “the head       hes
not patient ”


                                   ii

as mark closed the door behind him he immediately thought “now  theyre
both in there together  safe for a minute at least ” without even
waiting to get his hat he walked briskly to the front door and down the
drive  nothing but physical impossibility would stop him from going to
edgestow and warning jane  after that he had no plans  even the vague
idea of escaping to america which  in a simpler age  comforted so many a
fugitive  was denied him  he had already read in the papers the warm
approval of the n i c e  and all its works which came from the united
states and from russia  some poor tool just like himself had written
them  its claws were embedded in every country  on the liner  if he
should ever succeed in sailing  on the tender  if he should ever make
some foreign port  its ministers would be waiting for him 

now he was past the road  he was in the belt of trees  scarcely a minute
had passed since he had left the d d s office and no one had overtaken
him  but yesterdays adventure was happening over again  a tall 
stooped  shuffling  creaking figure  humming a tune  barred his way 
mark had never fought  ancestral impulses lodged in his body—that body
which was in so many ways wiser than his mind—directed the blow which he
aimed at the head of this senile obstructor  but there was no impact 
the shape had suddenly vanished 

those who know best were never fully agreed as to the explanation of
this episode  it may have been that mark  both then and on the previous
day  being over-wrought  saw a hallucination of wither where wither was
not  it may be that the continual appearance of wither which at almost
all hours haunted so many rooms and corridors of belbury was  in one
well-verified sense of the word  a ghost—one of those sensory
impressions which a strong personality in its last decay can imprint 
most commonly after death but sometimes before it  on the very structure
of a building  and which are removed not by exorcism but by
architectural alterations  or it may  after all  be that souls who have
lost the intellectual good do indeed receive in return  and for a short
period  the vain privilege of thus reproducing themselves in many places
as wraiths  at any rate the thing  whatever it was  vanished 

the path ran diagonally across a field in grass  now powdered with
frost  and the sky was hazy blue  then came a stile  after that the path
ran for three fields along the edge of a spinney  then a little to the
left  past the back parts of a farm  then along a ride through a wood 
after that the spire of courthampton was in sight  marks feet had now
got warm and he was beginning to feel hungry  then he went across a
road  through a herd of cattle that put down their heads and snorted at
him  across a stream by a foot-bridge  and so into the frozen ruts of
the lane that led him into courthampton 

the first thing he saw as he came into the village street was a
farm-cart  a woman and three children sat beside the man who was driving
it  and in the cart were piled chests of drawers  bedsteads  mattresses 
boxes  and a canary in a cage  immediately after it came a man and woman
and child on foot wheeling a perambulator  it also was piled with small
household property  after that came a family pushing a hand-cart  and
then a heavily loaded trap  and then an old car  blowing its horn
incessantly but unable to get out of its place in the procession  a
steady stream of such traffic was passing through the village  mark had
never seen war  if he had he would have recognised at once the signs of
flight  in all those plodding horses and men and in all those loaded
vehicles he would have read clearly the message “enemy behind ”

the traffic was so continuous that it took him a long time to get to the
cross-road by the pub where he could find a glazed and framed table of
buses  there would not be one to edgestow till 12 15  he hung about 
understanding nothing of what he saw  but wondering  courthampton was
normally a very quiet village  by a happy  and not uncommon  illusion he
felt less endangered now that belbury was out of sight  and thought
surprisingly little about his future  he thought sometimes about jane 
and sometimes about bacon and eggs  and fried fish  and dark  fragrant
streams of coffee pouring into large cups  at 11 30 the pub opened  he
went in and ordered a pint and some bread and cheese 

the bar was at first empty  during the next half-hour men dropped in one
by one till about four were present  they did not at first talk about
the unhappy procession which continued all this time to pass the
windows  for some time indeed they did not talk at all  then a very
little man with a face like an old potato observed to no one in
particular  “i seen old rumbold the other night ” no one replied for
five minutes and then a very young man in leggings said  “i reckon hes
sorry he ever tried it ” in this way conversation about rumbold trickled
on for some time  it was only when the subject of rumbold was thoroughly
exhausted that the talk  very indirectly and by gradual stages  began to
throw some light on the stream of refugees 

“still coming out ” said one man 

“ah ” said another 

“cant be many left there by now ”

“dont know where theyll all get in  im sure ”

little by little the whole thing came out  these were the refugees from
edgestow  some had been turned out of their houses  some scared by the
riots and still more by the restoration of order  something like a
terror appeared to have been established in the town  “they tell me
there were two hundred arrests yesterday ” said the landlord  “ah ” said
the young man  “theyre hard cases those n i c e  police  every one of
them  they put the wind up my old dad proper  i tell ee ” he ended with
a laugh  “taint the police so much as the workmen by what i hear ” said
another  “they never ought to have brought those welsh and irish ” but
that was about as far as criticism went  what struck mark deeply was the
almost complete absence of indignation among the speakers  or even of
any distinct sympathy with the refugees  everyone present knew of at
least one outrage in edgestow  but all agreed that these refugees must
be greatly exaggerating  “it says in this mornings paper that things
are pretty well settling down ” said the landlord  “thats right ”
agreed the others  “therell always be some who get awkward ” said the
potato-faced man  “whats the good of getting awkward ” asked another 
“its got to go on  you cant stop it ” “thats what i say ” said the
landlord  fragments of articles which mark himself had written drifted
to and fro  apparently he and his kind had done their work well  miss
hardcastle had rated too high the resistance of the working classes to
propaganda 

when the time came he had no difficulty in getting on to the bus  it was
indeed empty  for all the traffic was going in the opposite direction 
it put him down at the top of market street and he set out at once to
walk up to the flat  the whole town wore a new expression  one house out
of three was empty  about half the shops had their windows boarded up 
as he gained height and came into the region of large villas with
gardens he noticed that many of these had been requisitioned and bore
white placards with the n i c e  symbol—a muscular male nude grasping a
thunderbolt  at every corner  and often in between  lounged or sauntered
the n i c e  police  helmeted  swinging their clubs  with revolvers in
holsters on their black shiny belts  their round white faces with open
mouths slowly revolving as they chewed gum remained long in his memory 
there were also notices everywhere which he did not stop to read  they
were headed  emergency regulations  and bore the signature “feverstone ”

would jane be in  he felt he could not bear it if jane should not be in 
he was fingering his latchkey in his pocket long before he reached the
house  the front door was locked  this meant that the hutchinsons who
occupied the ground floor were away  he opened it and went in  it seemed
cold and damp on the staircase  cold and damp and dark on the landing 
“ja-ane ” he shouted as he unlocked the door of the flat  but he had
already lost hope  as soon as he was inside the door he knew the place
was uninhabited  a pile of unopened letters lay on the inside door-mat 
there was no sound  not a tick of a clock  everything was in order  jane
must have left some morning immediately after “doing” all the rooms  the
tea-cloths hanging in the kitchen were bone dry  they clearly had not
been used for at least twenty-four hours  the bread in the cupboard was
stale  there was a jug half full of milk  but the milk had thickened and
would not pour  he continued stumping from room to room long after he
was quite certain of the truth  staring at the staleness and pathos
which pervades deserted homes  but obviously it was no good hanging
about here  a splutter of unreasonable anger arose  why the hell hadnt
jane told him she was going away  or had someone taken her away  perhaps
there was a note for him  he took a pile of letters off the mantelpiece 
but they were only letters he had put there himself to be answered  then
on the table he noticed an envelope addressed to mrs  dimble at her own
house over beyond the wynd  so that damned woman had been here  those
dimbles had always  he felt  disliked him  theyd probably asked jane to
stay with them  been interfering somehow  no doubt  he must go down to
northumberland and see dimble 

the idea of being annoyed with the dimbles occurred to mark almost as an
inspiration  to bluster a little as an injured husband in search of his
wife would be a pleasant change from the attitudes he had recently been
compelled to adopt  on the way down town he stopped to have a drink  as
he came to the bristol and saw the n i c e  placard on it  he had almost
said “oh damn ” and turned away  before he suddenly remembered that he
was himself a high official in the n i c e  and by no means a member of
that general public whom the bristol now excluded  they asked him who he
was at the door and became obsequious when he told them  there was a
pleasant fire burning  after the gruelling day he had had he felt
justified in ordering a large whisky  and after it he had a second  it
completed the change in his mental weather which had begun at the moment
when he first conceived the idea of having a grievance against the
dimbles  the whole state of edgestow had something to do with it  there
was an element in him to which all these exhibitions of power suggested
chiefly how much nicer and how much more appropriate it was  all said
and done  to be part of the n i c e  than to be an outsider  even now
      had he been taking all this  démarche  about a murder trial too
seriously  of course that was the way wither managed things  he liked to
have something hanging over everyone  it was only a way to keep him at
belbury and to make him send for jane  and when one came to think of it 
why not  she couldnt go on indefinitely living alone  and the wife of a
man who meant to have a career and live at the centre of things would
have to learn to be a woman of the world  anyway  the first thing was to
see that fellow dimble 

he left the bristol feeling  as he would have said  a different man 
indeed he was a different man  from now onwards till the moment of final
decision should meet him  the different men in him appeared with
startling rapidity and each seemed very complete while it lasted  thus 
skidding violently from one side to the other  his youth approached the
moment at which he would begin to be a person 


                                  iii

“come in ” said dimble in his rooms at northumberland  he had just
finished with his last pupil for the day and was intending to start out
for st  annes in a few minutes  “oh  its you  studdock ” he added as
the door opened  “come in ” he tried to speak naturally but he was
surprised at the visit and shocked by what he saw  studdocks face
appeared to him to have changed since they last met  it had grown fatter
and paler and there was a new vulgarity in the expression 

“ive come to ask about jane ” said mark  “do you know where she is ”

“i cant give you her address  im afraid ” said dimble 

“do you mean you dont know it ”

“i cant give it ” said dimble 

according to marks programme this was the point at which he should have
begun to take a strong line  but he did not feel the same now that he
was in the room  dimble had always treated him with scrupulous
politeness and mark had always felt that dimble disliked him  this had
not made him dislike dimble  it had only made him uneasily talkative in
dimbles presence and anxious to please  vindictiveness was by no means
one of marks vices  for mark liked to be liked  a snub sent him away
dreaming not of revenge but of brilliant jokes or achievements which
would one day conquer the good will of the man who had snubbed him  if
he were ever cruel it would be downwards  to inferiors and outsiders who
solicited his regard  not upwards to those who rejected it  there was a
good deal of the spaniel in him 

“what do you mean ” he asked  “i dont understand ”

“if you have any regard for your wifes safety you will not ask me to
tell you where she has gone ” said dimble 

“safety ”

“safety ” repeated dimble with great sternness 

“safety from what ”

“dont you know what has happened ”

“whats happened ”

“on the night of the big riot the institutional police attempted to
arrest her  she escaped  but not before they had tortured her ”

“tortured her  what do you mean ”

“burned her with cigars ”

“thats what ive come about ” said mark  “jane—im afraid she is on the
verge of a nervous breakdown  that didnt really happen  you know ”

“the doctor who dressed the burns thinks otherwise ”

“great scot ” said mark  “so they really did  but  look here      ”

under the quiet stare of dimble he found it difficult to speak 

“why have i not been told about this outrage ” he shouted 

“by your colleagues ” asked dimble drily  “it is an odd question to ask
me  you ought to understand the workings of the n i c e better than i
do ”

“why didnt  you  tell me  why has nothing been done about it  have you
been to the police ”

“the institutional police ”

“no  the ordinary police ”

“do you really not know that there are no ordinary police left in
edgestow ”

“i suppose there are some magistrates ”

“there is the emergency commissioner  lord feverstone  you seem to
misunderstand  this is a conquered and occupied city ”

“then why  in heavens name  didnt you get on to me ”

“ you  ” said dimble 

for one moment  the first for many years  mark saw himself exactly as a
man like dimble saw him  it almost took his breath away 

“look here ” he said  “you dont       its too fantastic  you dont
imagine i knew about it  you dont really believe i send policemen about
to man-handle my own wife ” he had begun on the note of indignation  but
ended by trying to insinuate a little jocularity  if only dimble would
give even the ghost of a smile  anything to move the conversation on to
a different level 

but dimble said nothing and his face did not relax  he had not  in fact 
been perfectly sure that mark might not have sunk even to this  but out
of charity he did not wish to say so 

“i know youve always disliked me ” said mark  “but i didnt know it was
quite as bad as that ” and again dimble was silent  but for a reason
mark could not guess  the truth was that his shaft had gone home 
dimbles conscience had for years accused him of a lack of charity
towards studdock and he had struggled to amend it  he was struggling
now 

“well ” said studdock in a dry voice  after the silence had lasted for
several seconds  “there doesnt seem to be much more to say  i insist on
being told where jane is ”

“do you  want  her to be taken to belbury ”

mark winced  it was as if the other had read the very thought he had had
in the bristol half an hour ago 

“i dont see  dimble ” he said  “why i should be cross-questioned in
this way  where is my wife ”

“i have no permission to tell you  she is not in my house nor under my
care  she is well and happy and safe  if you still have the slightest
regard for her happiness you will make no attempt to get into touch with
her ”

“am i some sort of leper or criminal that i cant even be trusted to
know her address ”

“excuse me  you are a member of the n i c e  who have already insulted 
tortured  and arrested her  since her escape she has been left alone
only because your colleagues do not know where she is ”

“and if it really was the n i c e  police  do you suppose im not going
to have a very full explanation out of them  damn it  what do you take
me for ”

“i can only hope that you have no power in the n i c e  at all  if you
have no power  then you cannot protect her  if you have  then you are
identified with its policy  in neither case will i help you to discover
where jane is ”

“this is fantastic ” said mark  “even if i do happen to hold a job in
the n i c e  for the moment  you know  me  ”

“i do  not  know you ” said dimble  “i have no conception of your aims
or motives ”

he seemed to mark to be looking at him not with anger or contempt but
with that degree of loathing which produces in those who feel it a kind
of embarrassment—as if he were an obscenity which decent people are
forced  for very shame  to pretend that they have not noticed  in this
mark was quite mistaken  in reality his presence was acting on dimble as
a summons to rigid self-control  dimble was simply trying very hard not
to hate  not to despise  above all not to enjoy hating and despising 
and he had no idea of the fixed severity which this effort gave to his
face  the whole of the rest of the conversation went on under this
misunderstanding 

“there has been some ridiculous mistake ” said mark  “i tell you ill
look into it thoroughly  ill make a row  i suppose some newly enrolled
policeman got drunk or something  well  hell be broken  i——”

“it was the chief of your police  miss hardcastle herself  who did it ”

“very well  ill break  her  then  did you suppose i was going to take
it lying down  but there must be some mistake  it cant      ”

“do you know miss hardcastle well ” asked dimble  mark was silenced  and
he thought  quite wrongly  that dimble was reading his mind to the
bottom and seeing there his certainty that miss hardcastle had done this
very thing and that he had no more power of calling her to account than
of stopping the revolution of the earth 

suddenly the immobility of dimbles face changed  and he spoke in a new
voice  “have  you  the means to bring her to book ” he said  “are you
already as near the centre of belbury as that  if so  then you have
consented to the murder of hingest  the murder of compton  if so  it was
by your orders that mary prescott was raped and battered to death in the
sheds behind the station  it is with your approval that criminals—honest
criminals whose hands you are unfit to touch—are being taken from the
jails to which british judges sent them on the conviction of british
juries and packed off to belbury to undergo for an indefinite period 
out of reach of the law  whatever tortures and assaults on personal
identity you call remedial treatment  it is you who have driven two
thousand families from their homes to die of exposure in every ditch
from here to birmingham or worcester  it is you who can tell us why
place and rowley and cummingham  at eighty years of age  have been
arrested  and where they are  and if you are as deeply in it as that 
not only will i not deliver jane into your hands  but i would not
deliver my dog ”

“really—really ” said mark  “this is absurd  i know one or two
high-handed things have been done  you always get some of the wrong sort
in a police force—specially at first  but—i mean to say—what have i ever
done that you should make me responsible for every action that any
n i c e  official has taken—or is said to have taken in the gutter
press ”

“gutter press ” thundered dimble  who seemed to mark to be even
physically larger than he was a few minutes before  “what nonsense is
this  do you suppose i dont know that you have control of every paper
in the country except one  and that one has not appeared this morning 
its printers have gone on strike  the poor dupes say they will not print
articles attacking the peoples institute  where the lies in all the
other papers come from you know better than i ”

it may seem strange to say that mark  having long lived in a world
without charity  had nevertheless very seldom met real anger  malice in
plenty he had encountered  but it all operated by snubs and sneers and
stabbing in the back  the forehead and eyes and voice of this elderly
man had an effect on him which was stifling and unnerving  at belbury
one used the words “whining” and “yapping” to describe any opposition
which the actions of belbury aroused in the outer world  and mark had
never had enough imagination to realise what the “whining” would really
be like if you met it face to face 

“i tell you i knew nothing about it ” he shouted  “damn it  im the
injured party  the way you talk  anyone would think it was  your  wife
whod been ill treated ”

“so it might have been  so it may be  it may be any man or woman in
england  it was a woman and a citizen  what does it matter whose wife it
was ”

“but i tell you ill raise hell about it  ill break the infernal bitch
who did it  if it means breaking the whole n i c e ”

dimble said nothing  mark knew that dimble knew that he was now talking
nonsense  yet mark could not stop  if he did not bluster  he would not
know what to say 

“sooner than put up with this ” he shouted  “ill leave the n i c e ”

“do you mean that ” asked dimble with a sharp glance  and to mark  whose
ideas were now all one fluid confusion of wounded vanity and jostling
fears and shames  this glance once more appeared accusing and
intolerable  in reality it had been a glance of awakened hope  for
charity hopes all things  but there was caution in it  and between hope
and caution dimble found himself once more reduced to silence 

“i see you dont trust me ” said mark  instinctively summoning to his
face the manly and injured expression which had often served him well in
headmasters studies 

dimble was a truthful man  “no ” he said after a longish pause  “i dont
quite ”

mark shrugged his shoulders and turned away 

“studdock ” said dimble  “this is not a time for foolery  or
compliments  it may be that both of us are within a few minutes of
death  you have probably been shadowed into the college  and i  at any
rate  dont propose to die with polite insincerities in my mouth  i
dont trust you  why should i  you are  at least in some degree  the
accomplice of the worst men in the world  your very coming to me this
afternoon may be only a trap ”

“dont you know me better than  that  ” said mark 

“stop talking nonsense ” said dimble  “stop posturing and acting  if
only for a minute  who are you to talk like that  they have corrupted
better men than you or me before now  straik was a good man once 
filostrato was at least a great genius  even alcasan—yes  yes  i know
who your head is—was at least a plain murderer  something better than
they have now made of him  who are you to be exempt ”

mark gaped  the discovery of how much dimble knew had suddenly inverted
his whole picture of the situation 

“nevertheless ” continued dimble  “knowing all this—knowing that you may
be only the bait in the trap—i will take a risk  i will risk things
compared with which both our lives are a triviality  if you seriously
wish to leave the n i c e   i will help you ”

one moment it was like the gates of paradise opening—then  at once 
caution and the incurable wish to temporise rushed back  the chink had
closed again 

“i—id need to think that over ” he mumbled 

“there is no time ” said dimble  “and there is really nothing to think
about  i am offering you a way back into the human family  but you must
come at once ”

“its a question affecting my whole future career ”

“your career ” said dimble  “its a question of damnation or—a last
chance  but you must come at once ”

“i dont think i understand ” said mark  “you keep on suggesting some
kind of danger  what is it  and what powers have you to protect me—or
jane—if i do bolt ”

“you must risk that ” said dimble  “i can offer you no security  dont
you understand  there is no security for anyone now  the battle has
started  im offering you a place on the right side  i dont know which
will win ”

“as a matter of fact ” said mark  “i  had  been thinking of leaving  but
i must think it over  you put things in rather an odd way ”

“there is no time ” said dimble 

“supposing i look you up again to-morrow ”

“do you know that youll be able ”

“or in an hour  come  thats only sensible  will you be here in an
hours time ”

“what can an hour do for you  you are only waiting in the hope that your
mind will be less clear ”

“but will you be here ”

“if you insist  but no good can come of it ”

“i want to think  i want to think ” said mark  and left the room without
waiting for a reply 

mark had said he wanted to think  in reality he wanted alcohol and
tobacco  he had thoughts in plenty—more than he desired  one thought
prompted him to cling to dimble as a lost child clings to a grown-up 
another whispered to him “madness  dont  break  with the n i c e 
theyll be after you  how can dimble save you  youll be killed ” a
third implored him not  even now  to write off as a total loss his
hard-won position in the inner ring at belbury  there must  must be some
middle course  a fourth recoiled from the idea of ever seeing dimble
again  the memory of every tone dimble had used caused horrible
discomfort  and he wanted jane  and he wanted to punish jane for being a
friend of dimble  and he wanted never to see wither again  and he wanted
to creep back and patch things up with wither somehow  he wanted to be
perfectly safe and yet also very nonchalant and daring—to be admired for
manly honesty among the dimbles and yet also for realism and knowingness
at belbury—to have two more large whiskies and also to think everything
out very clearly and collectedly  and it was beginning to rain and his
head had begun to ache again  damn the whole thing  damn  damn  why had
he such a rotten heredity  why had his education been so ineffective 
why was the system of society so irrational  why was his luck so bad 

it was raining quite hard as he reached the college lodge  some sort of
van seemed to be standing in the street outside  and there were three or
four uniformed men in capes  he remembered afterwards how the wet
oilskin shone in the lamplight  a torch was flashed in his face 

“excuse me  sir ” said one of the men  “i must ask for your name ”

“studdock ” said mark 

“mark gainsby studdock ” said the man  “it is my duty to arrest you for
the murder of william hingest ”


                                   iv

dr  dimble drove out to st  annes dissatisfied with himself  haunted
with the suspicion that if he had been wiser  or more perfectly in
charity with this very miserable young man  he might have done something
for him  “did i give way to my temper  was i self-righteous  did i tell
him as much as i dared ” he thought  then came the deeper self-distrust
that was habitual with him  “did you fail to make things clear because
you really wanted not to  just wanted to hurt and humiliate  to enjoy
your own self-righteousness  is there a whole belbury inside you  too ”
the sadness that came over him had no novelty in it  “and thus ” he
quoted from brother lawrence  “thus i shall always do  whenever you
leave me to myself ”

once clear of the town  he drove slowly—almost sauntering on wheels  the
sky was red to westward and the first stars were out  far down below him
in a valley he saw the lights already lit in cure hardy  “thank heaven
it at any rate is far enough from edgestow to be safe ” he thought  the
sudden whiteness of a white owl flying low fluttered across the woody
twilight on his left  it gave him a delicious feeling of approaching
night  he was very pleasantly tired  he looked forward to an agreeable
evening and an early bed 

“here he is  heres dr  dimble ” shouted ivy maggs as he drove up to the
front door of the manor 

“dont put the car away  dimble ” said denniston 

“oh cecil ” said his wife  and he saw fear in her face  the whole
household seemed to have been waiting for him 

a few moments later  blinking in the lighted kitchen  he saw that this
was not to be a normal evening  the director himself was there  seated
by the fire  with the jackdaw on his shoulder and mr  bultitude at his
feet  there were signs that everyone else had had an early supper and
dimble found himself almost at once seated at the end of the table and
being rather excitedly urged to eat and drink by his wife and mrs 
maggs 

“dont stop to ask questions  dear ” said mrs  dimble  “go on eating
while they tell you  make a good meal ”

“you have to go out again ” said ivy maggs 

“yes ” said the director  “were going into action at last  im sorry to
send you out the moment you come in  but the battle has started ”

“i have already repeatedly urged ” said macphee  “the absurdity of
sending out an older man like yourself  thats done a days work forbye 
when here am i  a great strapping fellow sitting doing nothing ”

“its no good  macphee ” said the director  “you cant go  for one thing
you dont know the language  and for another—its a time for
frankness—you have never put yourself under the protection of maleldil ”

“i am perfectly ready ” said macphee  “in and for this emergency  to
allow the existence of these eldils of yours and of a being called
maleldil whom they regard as their king  and i——”

“you cant go ” said the director  “i will not send you  it would be
like sending a three-year-old child to fight a tank  put the other map
on the table where dimble can see it while he goes on with his meal  and
now  silence  this is the situation  dimble  what was under bragdon was
a living merlin  yes  asleep  if you like to call it sleep  and nothing
has yet happened to show that the enemy have found him  got that  no 
dont talk  go on eating  last night jane studdock had the most
important dream shes had yet  you remember that in an earlier dream she
saw  or so i thought  the very place where he lay under bragdon  but—and
this is the important thing—its not reached by a shaft and a stair  she
dreamed of going through a long tunnel with a very gradual descent  ah 
you begin to see the point  youre right  jane thinks she can recognise
the entrance to that tunnel  under a heap of stones at the end of a
copse with—what was it  jane ”

“a white gate  sir  an ordinary five-barred gate with a cross-piece  but
the cross-piece was broken off about a foot from the top  id know it
again ”

“you see  dimble  theres a very good chance that this tunnel comes up
 outside  the area held by the n i c e ”

“you mean ” said dimble  “that we can now get  under  bragdon without
going into bragdon ”

“exactly  but thats not all ”

dimble  steadily munching  looked at him 

“apparently ” said the director  “we are almost too late  he has waked
already ”

dimble stopped eating 

“jane found the place empty ” said ransom 

“you mean the enemy have already found him ”

“no  not quite as bad as that  the place had not been broken into  he
seems to have waked of his own accord ”

“my god ” said dimble 

“try to eat  darling ” said his wife 

“but what does it mean ” he asked  covering her hand with his 

“i think it means that the whole thing has been planned and timed long 
long ago ” said the director  “that he went out of time  into the
parachronic state  for the very purpose of returning at this moment ”

“a sort of human time-bomb ” observed macphee  “which is why——”

“you cant go  macphee ” said the director 

“is he  out  ” asked dimble 

“he probably is by now ” said the director  “tell him what it was like 
jane ”

“it was the same place ” said jane  “a dark place  all stone  like a
cellar  i recognised it at once  and the slab of stone was there  but no
one lying on it  and this time it wasnt quite cold  then i dreamed
about this tunnel       gradually sloping up from the  souterrain   and
there was a man in the tunnel  of course i couldnt see him  it was
pitch dark  but a great big man  breathing heavily  at first i thought
it was an animal  it got colder as we went up the tunnel  there was
air—a little air—from outside  it seemed to end in a pile of loose
stones  he was pulling them about just before the dream changed  then i
was outside  in the rain  that was when i saw the white gate ”

“it looks  you see ” said ransom  “as if they had not yet—or not
then—established contact with him  that is our only chance now  to meet
this creature before they do ”

“you will all have observed that bragdon is very nearly water-logged ”
put in macphee  “where exactly youll find a dry cavity in which a body
could be preserved all these centuries is a question worth asking  that
is  if any of you are still concerned with evidence ”

“thats the point ” said the director  “the chamber must be under the
high ground—the gravelly ridge on the south of the wood where it slopes
up to the eaton road  near where storey used to live  thats where
youll have to look first for janes white gate  i suspect it opens on
the eaton road  or else that other road—look at the map—the yellow one
that runs up into the y of cure hardy ”

“we can be there in half an hour ” said dimble  his hand still on his
wifes hand  to everyone in that room the sickening excitement of the
last minutes before battle had come nearer 

“i suppose it must be to-night ” said mrs  dimble  rather shamefacedly 

“i am afraid it must  margaret ” said the director  “every minute
counts  we have practically lost the war if the enemy once make contact
with him  their whole plan probably turns on it ”

“of course  i see  im sorry ” said mrs  dimble 

“and what is our procedure  sir ” said dimble  pushing his plate away
from him and beginning to fill his pipe 

“the first question is whether hes  out  ” said the director  “it
doesnt seem likely that the entrance to the tunnel has been hidden all
these centuries by nothing but a heap of loose stones  and if it has 
they wouldnt be very loose by now  he may take hours getting out ”

“youll need at least two strong men with picks——” began macphee 

“its no good  macphee ” said the director  “im not letting you go  if
the mouth of the tunnel is still sealed  you must just wait there  but
he may have powers we dont know  if hes out  you must look for tracks 
thank god its a muddy night  you must just hunt him ”

“if jane is going  sir ” said camilla  “couldnt i go too  ive had more
experience of this sort of thing than——”

“jane has to go because she is the guide ” said ransom  “i am afraid you
must stay at home  we in this house are all that is left of logres  you
carry its future in your body  as i was saying  dimble  you must hunt  i
do not think he can get far  the country will  of course  be quite
unrecognisable to him  even by daylight ”

“and       if we do find him  sir ”

“that is why it must be you  dimble  only you know the great tongue  if
there was eldilic power behind the tradition he represented he may
understand it  even if he does not understand it he will  i think 
recognise it  that will teach him he is dealing with masters  there is a
chance that he will think  you  are the belbury people—his friends  in
that case you will bring him here at once ”

“and if not ”

“then you must show your hand  that is the moment when the danger comes 
we do not know what the powers of the old atlantean circle were  some
kind of hypnotism probably covered most of it  dont be afraid  but
dont let him try any tricks  keep your hand on your revolver  you too 
denniston ”

“im a good hand with a revolver myself ” said macphee  “and why  in the
name of all common sense——”

“you cant go  macphee ” said the director  “hed put  you  to sleep in
ten seconds  the others are heavily protected as you are not  you
understand  dimble  your revolver in your hand  a prayer on your lips 
your mind fixed on maleldil  then  if he stands  conjure him ”

“what shall i say in the great tongue ”

“say that you come in the name of god and all angels and in the power of
the planets from one who sits to-day in the seat of the pendragon  and
command him to come with you  say it now ”

and dimble  who had been sitting with his face drawn and rather white 
between the white faces of the two women  and his eyes on the table 
raised his head  and great syllables of words that sounded like castles
came out of his mouth  jane felt her heart leap and quiver at them 
everything else in the room seemed to have become intensely quiet  even
the bird  and the bear  and the cat  were still  staring at the speaker 
the voice did not sound like dimbles own  it was as if the words spoke
themselves through him from some strong place at a distance—or as if
they were not words at all but present operations of god  the planets 
and the pendragon  for this was the language spoken before the fall and
beyond the moon  and the meanings were not given to the syllables by
chance  or skill  or long tradition  but truly inherent in them as the
shape of the great sun is inherent in the little waterdrop  this was
language herself  as she first sprang at maleldils bidding out of the
molten quicksilver of the star called mercury on earth  but viritrilbia
in deep heaven 

“thank you ” said the director in english  and once again the warm
domesticity of the kitchen flowed back upon them  “and if he comes with
you  all is well  if he does not—why then  dimble  you must rely on your
christianity  do not try any tricks  say your prayers and keep your will
fixed in the will of maleldil  i dont know what he will do  but stand
firm  you cant lose your soul  whatever happens  at least  not by any
action of his ”

“yes ” said dimble  “i understand ”

there was a longish pause  then the director spoke again 

“dont be cast down  margaret ” he said  “if they kill cecil we shall
none of us be let live many hours after him  it will be a shorter
separation than you could have hoped for in the course of nature  and
now  gentlemen ” he said  “you would like a little time to say your
prayers  and to say good-bye to your wives  it is eight now  as near as
makes no matter  suppose you all reassemble here at ten past eight 
ready to start ”

“very good ” answered several voices  jane found herself left alone in
the kitchen with mrs  maggs and the animals and macphee and the
director 

“ you  are all right  child ” said ransom 

“i think so  sir ” said jane  her actual state of mind was one she could
not analyse  her expectation was strung up to the height  something that
would have been terror but for the joy  and joy but for the terror 
possessed her—an all-absorbing tension of excitement and obedience 
everything else in her life seemed small and commonplace compared with
this moment 

“do you place yourself in the obedience ” said the director  “in
obedience to maleldil ”

“sir ” said jane  “i know nothing of maleldil  but i place myself in
obedience to you ”

“it is enough for the present ” said the director  “this is the courtesy
of deep heaven  that when you mean well  he always takes you to have
meant better than you knew  it will not be enough for always  he is very
jealous  he will have you for no one but himself in the end  but for
to-night  it is enough ”

“this is the craziest business that ever i heard of ” said macphee 




                                 eleven
                              battle begun 


                                   i

“i cant see a thing ” said jane 

“this rain is spoiling the whole plan ” said dimble from the back seat 
“is this still eaton road  arthur ”

“i think       yes  theres the toll-house ” said denniston who was
driving 

“but whats the use ” said jane  “i cant see  even with the window
down  we might have passed it any number of times  the only thing is to
get out and walk ”

“i think shes right  sir ” said denniston 

“i say ” said jane suddenly  “look  look  whats that  stop ”

“i cant see a white gate ” said denniston 

“oh  its not that ” said jane  “look over there ”

“i cant see anything ” said dimble 

“do you mean that light ” said denniston 

“yes  of course  thats the fire ”

“what fire ”

“its the light ” she said  “the fire in the hollow in the little wood 
id forgotten all about it  yes  i know  i never told grace  or the
director  id forgotten that part of the dream till this moment  that
was how it ended  it was the most important part really  that was where
i found  him —merlin  you know  sitting by a fire in a little wood 
after i came out of the place underground  oh  come quickly ”

“what do you think  arthur ” said dimble 

“i think we must go wherever jane leads ” answered denniston 

“oh  do hurry ” said jane  “theres a gate here  quick  its only one
field away ”

all three of them crossed the road and opened the gate and went into the
field  dimble said nothing  he was inwardly reeling under the shock and
shame of the immense and sickening fear which had surged up inside him 
he had  perhaps  a clearer idea than the others of what sort of things
might happen when they reached the place 

jane  as guide  went first  and denniston beside her  giving her his arm
and showing an occasional gleam of his torch on the rough ground  dimble
brought up the rear  no one was inclined to speak 

the change from the road to the field was as if one had passed from a
waking into a phantasmal world  everything became darker  wetter  more
incalculable  each small descent felt as if you might be coming to the
edge of a precipice  they were following a track beside a hedge  wet and
prickly tentacles seemed to snatch at them as they went  whenever
denniston used his torch  the things that appeared within the circle of
its light—tufts of grass  ruts filled with water  draggled yellow leaves
clinging to the wet blackness of many-angled twigs  and once the two
greenish-yellow fires in the eyes of some small animal—had the air of
being more commonplace than they ought to have been  as if  for that
moments exposure  they had assumed a disguise which they would shuffle
off again the moment they were left alone  they looked curiously small 
too  when the light vanished  the cold  noisy darkness seemed a huge
thing 

the fear which dimble had felt from the first began to trickle into the
minds of the others as they proceeded—like water coming into a ship from
a slow leak  they realised that they had not really believed in merlin
till now  they had thought they were believing the director in the
kitchen  but they had been mistaken  the shock was still to take  out
here  with only the changing red light ahead and the black all round 
one really began to accept as fact this tryst with something dead and
yet not dead  something dug up  exhumed  from that dark pit of history
which lies between the ancient romans and the beginning of the english 
“the dark ages ” thought dimble  how lightly one had read and written
those words  but now they were going to step right into that darkness 
it was an age  not a man  that awaited them in the horrible little
dingle 

and suddenly all that britain which had been so long familiar to him as
a scholar rose up like a solid thing  he could see it all  little
dwindling cities where the light of rome still rested—little christian
sites  camalodunum  kaerleon  glastonbury—a church  a villa or two  a
huddle of houses  an earthwork  and then  beginning scarcely a
stones-throw beyond the gates  the wet  tangled  endless woods  silted
with the accumulated decay of autumns that had been dropping leaves
since before britain was an island  wolves slinking  beavers building 
wide shallow marshes  dim horns and drummings  eyes in the thickets 
eyes of men not only pre-roman but pre-british  ancient creatures 
unhappy and dispossessed  who became the elves and ogres and wood-wooses
of the later tradition  but worse than the forests  the clearings 
little strongholds with unheard-of kings  little colleges and covines of
druids  houses whose mortar had been ritually mixed with babies blood 
they had tried to do that to merlin  and now all that age  horribly
dislocated  wrenched out of its place in the time series and forced to
come back and go through all its motions yet again with doubled
monstrosity  was flowing towards them and would  in a few minutes 
receive them into itself 

then came a check  they had walked right into a hedge  they wasted a
minute  with the aid of the torch  disentangling janes hair  they had
come to the end of a field  the light of the fire  which kept on growing
stronger and weaker in fitful alternations  was hardly visible from
here  there was nothing for it but to set to work and find a gap or a
gate  they went a long way out of their course before they found one  it
was a gate that would not open  and as they came down on the far side 
after climbing it  they went ankle-deep into water  for a few minutes 
plodding slightly uphill  they were out of sight of the fire  and when
it reappeared it was well away on their left and much farther off than
anyone had supposed 

hitherto jane had scarcely attempted to think of what might lie before
them  as they went on  the real meaning of that scene in the kitchen
began to dawn on her  he had sent the men to bid good-bye to their
wives  he had blessed them all  it was likely  then  that this—this
stumbling walk on a wet night across a ploughed field—meant death 
death—the thing one had always heard of  like love   the thing the poets
had written about  so this was how it was going to be  but that was not
the main point  jane was trying to see death in the new light of all she
had heard since she left edgestow  she had long ceased to feel any
resentment at the directors tendency  as it were  to dispose of her—to
give her  at one time or in one sense  to mark  and in another to
maleldil  never  in any sense  to keep her for himself  she accepted
that  and of mark she did not think much  because to think of him
increasingly aroused feelings of pity and guilt  but maleldil  up till
now she had not thought of maleldil either  she did not doubt that the
eldils existed  nor did she doubt the existence of this stronger and
more obscure being whom they obeyed       whom the director obeyed  and
through him the whole household  even macphee  if it had ever occurred
to her to question whether all these things might be the reality behind
what she had been taught at school as “religion ” she had put the
thought aside  the distance between these alarming and operative
realities and the memory  say  of fat mrs  dimble saying her prayers 
was too wide  the things belonged  for her  to different worlds  on the
one hand  terror of dreams  rapture of obedience  the tingling light and
sound from under the directors door  and the great struggle against an
imminent danger  on the other  the smell of pews  horrible lithographs
of the saviour  apparently seven feet high  with the face of a
consumptive girl   the embarrassment of confirmation classes  the
nervous affability of clergymen  but this time  if it was really to be
death  the thought would not be put aside  because  really  it now
appeared that almost anything might be true  the world had already
turned out to be so very unlike what she had expected  the old
ring-fence had been smashed completely  one might be in for anything 
maleldil might be  quite simply and crudely  god  there might be a life
after death  a heaven  a hell  the thought glowed in her mind for a
second like a spark that has fallen on shavings  and then a second
later  like those shavings  her whole mind was in a blaze—or with just
enough left outside the blaze to utter some kind of protest  “but      
this is unbearable  i ought to have been told ” it did not  at that
moment  occur to her even to doubt that if such things existed they
would be totally and unchangeably adverse to her 

“look out  jane ” said denniston  “thats a tree ”

“i—i think its a cow ” said jane 

“no  its a tree  look  theres another ”

“hush ” said dimble  “this is janes little wood  we are very close
now ”

the ground rose in front of them for about twenty yards and there made
an edge against the firelight  they could see the wood quite clearly
now  and also each others faces  white and blinking 

“i will go first ” said dimble 

“i envy you your nerve ” said jane 

“hush ” said dimble again 

they walked slowly and quietly up to the edge and stopped  below them a
big fire of wood was burning at the bottom of a little dingle  there
were bushes all about  whose changing shadows  as the flames rose and
fell  made it difficult to see clearly  beyond the fire there seemed to
be some rude kind of tent made out of sacking  and denniston thought he
saw an upturned cart  in the foreground  between them and the fire 
there was certainly a kettle 

“is there anyone here ” whispered dimble to denniston 

“i dont know  wait a few seconds ”

“look ” said jane suddenly  “there  when the flame blew aside ”

“what ” said dimble 

“didnt you see him ”

“i saw nothing ”

“i thought i saw a man ” said denniston 

“i saw an ordinary tramp ” said dimble  “i mean a man in modern
clothes ”

“what did he look like ”

“i dont know ”

“we must go down ” said dimble 

“ can  one get down ” said denniston 

“not this side ” said dimble  “it looks as if a sort of path came into
it over there to the right  we must go along the edge till we find the
way down ”

they had all been talking in low voices and the crackling of the fire
was now the loudest sound  for the rain seemed to be stopping 
cautiously  like troops who fear the eye of the enemy  they began to
skirt the lip of the hollow  stealing from tree to tree 

“stop ” whispered jane suddenly 

“what is it ”

“theres something moving ”

“where ”

“in there  quite close ”

“i heard nothing ”

“theres nothing now ”

“lets go on ”

“do you still think theres something  jane ”

“its quiet now  there  was  something ”

they made a few paces more 

“st ” said denniston  “janes right  there is something ”

“shall i speak ” said dimble 

“wait a moment ” said denniston  “its just there  look —damn it  its
only an old donkey ”

“thats what i said ” said dimble  “the mans a gypsy  a tinker or
something  this is his donkey  still  we must go down ”

they proceeded  in a few moments they found themselves descending a
rutted grassy path which wound about till the whole hollow opened before
them  and now the fire was no longer between them and the tent  “there
he is ” said jane 

“can you see him ” said dimble  “i havent got your eyes ”

“i can see him all right ” said denniston  “it  is  a tramp  cant you
see him dimble  an old man with a ragged beard in what looks like the
remains of a british warm and a pair of black trousers  dont you see
his left foot  stuck out  and the toe a bit up in the air ”

“that ” said dimble  “i thought that was a log  but youve better eyes
than i have  did you really see a man  arthur ”

“well  i thought i did  sir  but im not certain now  i think my eyes
are getting tired  hes sitting very still  if it  is  a man  hes
asleep ”

“or dead ” said jane with a sudden shudder 

“well ” said dimble  “we must go down ”

and in less than a minute all three walked down into the dingle and past
the fire  and there was the tent  and a few miserable attempts at
bedding inside it  and a tin plate  and some matches on the ground  and
the dottle of a pipe  but they could see no man 


                                   ii

“what i cant understand  wither ” said fairy hardcastle  “is why you
dont let me try my hand on the young pup  all these ideas of yours are
so half-hearted—keeping him on his toes about the murder  arresting him 
leaving him all night in the cells to think it over  why do you keep
messing about with things that may work or may not —when twenty minutes
of my treatment would turn his mind inside out  i know the type ”

miss hardcastle was talking  at about ten oclock that same wet night 
to the deputy director in his study  there was a third person
present—professor frost 

“i assure you  miss hardcastle ” said wither  fixing his eyes not on her
but on frosts forehead  “you need not doubt that your views on this  or
any other matter  will always receive the fullest consideration  but if
i may say so  this is one of those cases where—ah—any grave degree of
coercive examination might defeat its own end ”

“why ” said the fairy sulkily 

“you must excuse me ” said wither  “for reminding you—not  of course 
that i assume you are neglecting the point  but simply on methodological
grounds—it is so important to make everything  clear —that we need the
woman—i mean  that it would be of the greatest value to welcome mrs 
studdock among us—chiefly on account of the remarkable psychical faculty
she is said to possess  in using the word  psychical   i am not  you
understand  committing myself to any particular theory ”

“you mean these dreams ”

“it is very doubtful ” said wither  “what effect it might have on her if
she were brought here under compulsion and then found her husband—ah—in
the markedly  though no doubt temporarily  abnormal condition which we
should have to anticipate as a result of your scientific methods of
examination  one would run the risk of a profound emotional disturbance
on her part  the faculty itself might disappear  at least for a long
time ”

“we have not yet had major hardcastles report ” said professor frost
quietly 

“no good ” said the fairy  “he was shadowed into northumberland  only
three possible people left the college after him—lancaster  lyly  and
dimble  i put them in that order of probability  lancaster is a
christian  and a very influential man  hes in the lower house of
convocation  he had a lot to do with the repton conference  hes mixed
up with several big clerical families  and hes written a lot of books 
he has a real stake in their side  lyly is rather the same type  but
less of an organiser  as you will remember  he did a great deal of harm
on that reactionary commission about education last year  both these are
dangerous men  they are the sort of people who get things done—natural
leaders of the other party  dimble is quite a different type  except
that hes a christian  there isnt really much against him  hes purely
academic  i shouldnt think his name is much known  except to other
scholars in his own subject  not the kind that would make a public man 
impractical       hed be too full of scruples to be much use to them 
the others know a thing or two  lancaster particularly  in fact  hes a
man we could find room for on our own side if he held the right views ”

“you should tell major hardcastle that we have access to most of these
facts already ” said professor frost 

“perhaps ” said wither  “in view of the late hour—we dont wish to
overtax your energies  miss hardcastle—we might go on to the more
strictly narrative parts of your report ”

“well ” said the fairy  “i had to follow all three  with the resources i
had at the moment  youll realise young studdock was seen setting off
for edgestow only by good luck  it was a bomb-shell  half my people were
already busy on the hospital affair  i just had to lay my hands on
anyone i could get  i posted a sentry and had six others out of sight of
the college  in plain clothes of course  as soon as lancaster came out i
told off the three best to keep him in sight  ive had a wire from them
half an hour ago from london where lancaster went off by train  we may
be on to something there  lyly gave the devil of a lot of trouble  he
appeared to be calling on about fifteen different people in edgestow 
weve got them all noted—i sent the next two of my lads to deal with
him  dimble came out last  i would have sent my last man off to follow
him  but a call came through at that moment from captain ohara  who
wanted another car  so i decided to let dimble go for to-night and sent
my man up with the one he had  dimble can be got any time  he comes into
college pretty regularly every day  and hes really a nonentity ”

“i do not quite understand ” said frost  “why you had no one inside the
college to see what staircase studdock went to ”

“because of your damned emergency commissioner ” said the fairy  “were
not  allowed  into colleges now  if you please  i said at the time that
feverstone was the wrong man  hes trying to play on both sides  hes
for us against the town  but when it comes to us against the university
hes unreliable  mark my words  wither  youll have trouble with him
yet ”

frost looked at the deputy director 

“i am far from denying ” said wither  “though without at all closing my
mind to other possible explanations  that some of lord feverstones
measures may have been injudicious  it would be inexpressibly painful to
me to suppose that——”

“need we keep major hardcastle ” said frost 

“bless my soul ” said wither  “how very right of you  i had almost
forgotten  my dear lady  how tired you must be  and how very valuable
your time is  we must try to save you for that particular kind of work
in which you have shown yourself indispensable  you must not allow us to
impose on your good nature  there is a lot of duller and more routine
work which it is only reasonable that you should be spared ” he got up
and held the door open for her 

“you dont think ” said she  “that i ought to let the boys have just a
 little  go at studdock  i mean  it seems so absurd to have all this
trouble about getting an address ”

and suddenly  as wither stood with his hand on the door-handle  courtly 
patient  and smiling  the whole expression faded out of his face  the
pale lips  open wide enough to show his gums  the white curly head  the
pouchy eyes  ceased to make up any single expression  miss hardcastle
had the feeling that a mere mask of skin and flesh was staring at her  a
moment later and she was gone 

“i wonder ” said wither as he came back to his chair  “whether we are
attaching too much importance to this studdock woman ”

“we are acting on an order dated the 14th of october ” said frost 

“oh       i wasnt questioning it ” said wither with a gesture of
deprecation 

“allow me to remind you of the facts ” said frost  “the authorities had
access to the womans mind for only a very short time  they inspected
only one important dream—a dream  which revealed  though with some
irrelevancies  an essential element in our programme  that warned us
that if the woman fell into the hands of any ill-affected persons who
knew how to exploit her faculty  she would constitute a grave danger ”

“oh  to be sure  to be sure  i never intended to deny——”

“that was the first point ” said frost  interrupting him  “the second is
that her mind became opaque to our authorities almost immediately
afterwards  in the present state of our science we know only one cause
for such occultations  they occur when the mind in question has placed
itself  by some voluntary choice of its own  however vague  under the
control of some hostile organism  the occultation  therefore  while
cutting off our access to the dreams  also tells us that she has  in
some mode or other  come under enemy influence  this is in itself a
grave danger  but it also means that to find her would probably mean
discovering the enemys headquarters  miss hardcastle is probably right
in maintaining that torture would soon induce studdock to give up his
wifes address  but as you pointed out  a round-up at their
headquarters  an arrest  and the discovery of her husband here in the
condition in which the torture would leave him  would produce
psychological conditions in the woman which might destroy her faculty 
we should thus frustrate one of the purposes for which we want to get
her  that is the first objection  the second is  that an attack on enemy
headquarters is very risky  they almost certainly have protection of a
kind we are not prepared to cope with  and  finally  the man may not
 know  his wifes address  in that case      ”

“oh ” said wither  “there is nothing i should more deeply deplore 
scientific examination  i cannot allow the word  torture  in this
context  in cases where the patient doesnt  know  the answer is always
a fatal mistake  as men of humanity we should neither of us       and
then  if you go on  the patient naturally does not recover       and if
you stop  even an experienced operator is haunted by the fear that
perhaps he  did  know after all  it is in every way unsatisfactory ”

“there is  in fact  no way of implementing our instructions except by
inducing studdock to bring his wife here himself ”

“or else ” said wither  a little more dreamily than usual  “if it were
possible  by inducing in him a much more radical allegiance to our side
than he has yet shown  i am speaking  my dear friend  of a real change
of heart ”

frost slightly opened and extended his mouth  which was a very long one 
so as to show his white teeth 

“that ” he said  “is a subdivision of the plan i was mentioning  i was
saying that he must be induced to send for the woman himself  that  of
course  can be done in two ways  either by supplying him with some
motive on the instinctive level  such as fear of us or desire for her 
or else by conditioning him to identify himself so completely with the
cause that he will understand the real motive for securing her person
and act on it ”

“exactly       exactly ” said wither  “your expressions  as always  are
a little different from those i would choose myself  but      ”

“where is studdock at present ” said frost 

“in one of the cells here—on the other side ”

“under the impression he has been arrested by the ordinary police ”

“that i cannot answer for  i presume he would be  it does not  perhaps 
make much difference ”

“and how are you proposing to act ”

“we had proposed to leave him to himself for several hours—to allow the
psychological results of the arrest to mature  i have ventured       of
course  with every regard for humanity       to reckon on the value of
some slight physical discomforts—he will not have dined  you understand 
they have instructions to empty his pockets  one would not wish the
young man to relieve any nervous tension that may have arisen by
smoking  one wishes the mind to be thrown entirely on its own
resources ”

“of course  and what next ”

“well  i suppose some sort of examination  that is a point on which i
should welcome your advice  i mean  as to whether i  personally  should
appear in the first instance  i am inclined to think that the appearance
of examination by the ordinary police should be maintained a little
longer  then at a later stage will come the discovery that he is still
in our hands  he will probably misunderstand this discovery at first—for
several minutes  it would be well to let him realise only gradually that
this by no means frees him from the—er—embarrassments arising out of
hingests death  i take it that some fuller realisation of his
inevitable solidarity with the institute would then follow       ”

“and then you mean to ask him again for his wife ”

“i shouldnt do it at all like that ” said wither  “if i might venture
to say so  it is one of the disadvantages of that extreme simplicity and
accuracy with which you habitually speak  much as we all admire it  that
it leaves no room for fine shades  one had rather hoped for a
spontaneous outburst of confidence on the part of the young man himself 
anything like a direct demand——”

“the weakness of the plan ” said frost  “is that you are relying wholly
on fear ”

“fear ” repeated wither as if he had not heard the word before  “i do
not quite follow the connection of thought  i can hardly suppose you are
following the opposite suggestion  once made  if i remember rightly  by
miss hardcastle ”

“what was that ”

“why ” said wither  “if i understand her aright she thought of taking
scientific measures to render the society of his wife more desirable in
the young mans eyes  some of the chemical resources      ”

“you mean an aphrodisiac ”

wither sighed gently and said nothing 

“that is nonsense ” said frost  “it isnt to his wife that a man turns
under the influence of aphrodisiacs  but as i was saying  i think it is
a mistake to rely wholly on fear  i have observed  over a number of
years  that its results are incalculable  especially when the fear is
complicated  the patient may get too frightened to move  even in the
desired direction  if we have to despair of getting the woman here with
her husbands goodwill  we must use torture and take the consequences 
but there are other alternatives  there is desire ”

“i am not sure that i am following you  you have rejected the idea of
any medical or chemical approach ”

“i was thinking of stronger desires ”

neither at this stage of the conversation nor at any other did the
deputy director look much at the face of frost  his eyes  as usual 
wandered over the whole room or fixed themselves on distant objects 
sometimes they were shut  but either frost or wither—it was difficult to
say which—had been gradually moving his chair  so that by this time the
two men sat with their knees almost touching 

“i had my conversation with filostrato ” said frost in his low  clear
voice  “i used expressions which must have made my meaning clear if he
had any notion of the truth  his senior assistant  wilkins  was present
too  the truth is that neither is really interested  what interests them
is the fact that they have succeeded—as they think—in keeping the head
alive and getting it to talk  what it says does not really interest
them  as to any question about what is really speaking  they have no
curiosity  i went very far  i raised questions about its mode of
consciousness—its sources of information  there was no response ”

“you are suggesting  if i understand you ” said wither  “a movement
towards this mr  studdock along  those  lines  if i remember rightly 
you rejected fear on the ground that its effects could not really be
predicted with the accuracy one might wish  but—ah—would the method now
envisaged be any  more  reliable  i need hardly say that i fully realise
a certain disappointment which serious-minded people must feel with such
colleagues as filostrato and his subordinate  mr  wilkins ”

“that is the point ” said frost  “one must guard against the error of
supposing that the political and economic dominance of england by the
n i c e  is more than a subordinate object  it is individuals that we
are really concerned with  a hard unchangeable core of individuals
really devoted to the same cause as ourselves—that is what we need and
what  indeed  we are under orders to supply  we have not succeeded so
far in bringing many people in—really  in  ”

“there is still no news from bragdon wood ”

“no ”

“and you believe that studdock might really be a suitable person ”

“you must not forget ” said frost  “that his value does not rest solely
on his wifes clairvoyance  the couple are eugenically interesting  and
secondly  i think he can offer no resistance  the hours of fear in the
cell  and then an appeal to desires that undercut the fear  will have an
almost certain effect on a character of that sort ”

“of course ” said wither  “nothing is so much to be desired as the
greatest possible unity  you will not suspect me of underrating that
aspect of our orders  any fresh individual brought into that unity would
be a source of the most intense satisfaction—to—ah—all concerned  i
desire the closest possible bond  i would welcome an interpenetration of
personalities so close  so irrevocable  that it almost transcends
individuality  you need not doubt that i would open my arms to
receive—to absorb—to assimilate this young man ”

they were now sitting so close together that their faces almost touched 
as if they had been lovers about to kiss  frosts pince-nez caught the
light so that they made his eyes invisible  only his mouth  smiling but
not relaxed in the smile  revealed his expression  withers mouth was
open  the lower lip hanging down  his eyes wet  his whole body hunched
and collapsed in his chair as if the strength had gone out of it  a
stranger would have thought he had been drinking  then his shoulders
twitched and gradually he began to laugh  and frost did not laugh  but
his smile grew moment by moment brighter and also colder  and he
stretched out his hand and patted his colleague on the shoulder 
suddenly in that silent room there was a crash   whos who  had fallen
off the table  swept onto the floor as  with sudden  swift convulsive
movement  the two old men lurched forward towards each other and sat
swaying to and fro  locked in an embrace from which each seemed to be
struggling to escape  and as they swayed and scrabbled with hand and
nail  there arose  shrill and faint at first  but then louder and
louder  a cackling noise that seemed in the end rather an animal than a
senile parody of laughter 


                                  iii

when mark was bundled out of the police waggon into the dark and rain
and hurried indoors between two constables and left at length alone in a
little lighted room  he had no idea that he was at belbury  nor would he
have cared greatly if he had known  for the moment he was arrested he
had despaired of his life  he was going to be hanged 

he had never till now been at close quarters with death  now  glancing
down at his hand  because his hands were cold and he had been
automatically rubbing them  it came to him as a totally new idea that
this very hand  with its five nails and the yellow tobacco-stain on the
inside of the second finger  would soon be the hand of a corpse  and
later the hand of a skeleton  he did not exactly feel horror  though on
the physical level he was aware of a choking sensation  what made his
brain reel was the preposterousness of the idea  this was something
incredible  yet at the same time quite certain 

there came a sudden uprush of grisly details about execution  supplied
long since by miss hardcastle  but that was a dose too strong for the
consciousness to accept  it hovered before his imagination for a
fraction of a second  agonising him to a kind of mental scream  and then
sank away in a blur  mere death returned as the object of attention  the
question of immortality came before him  he was not in the least
interested  what had an after-life to do with it  happiness in some
other and disembodied world  he never thought of unhappiness  was
totally irrelevant to a man who was going to be killed  the killing was
the important thing  on any view  this body—this limp  shaking 
desperately vivid thing  so intimately his own—was going to be turned
into a  dead  body  if there were such things as souls  this cared
nothing about them  the choking  smothering sensation gave the bodys
view of the matter with an intensity which excluded all else 

because he felt that he was choking  he looked round the cell for any
sign of ventilation  there was  in fact  some sort of grating above the
door  that ventilator and the door itself were the only objects to
detain the eye  all else was white floor  white ceiling  white wall 
without a chair or table or book or peg  and with one hard white light
in the centre of the ceiling 

something in the look of the place now suggested to him for the first
time the idea that he might be at belbury and not in an ordinary police
station  but the flash of hope aroused by this idea was so brief as to
be instantaneous  what difference did it make whether wither and miss
hardcastle and the rest had decided to get rid of him by handing him
over to the ordinary police or by making away with him in private—as
they had doubtless done with hingest  the meaning of all the ups and
downs he had experienced at belbury now appeared to him perfectly plain 
they were all his enemies  playing upon his hopes and fears to reduce
him to complete servility  certain to kill him if he broke away  and
certain to kill him in the long run when he had served the purpose for
which they wanted him  it appeared to him astonishing that he could ever
have thought otherwise  how could he have supposed that any real
conciliation of these people could be achieved by anything he did 

what a fool—a blasted  babyish  gullible fool—he had been  he sat down
on the floor  for his legs felt weak  as if he had walked twenty-five
miles  why had he come to belbury in the first instance  ought not his
very first interview with the deputy director to have warned him  as
clearly as if the truth were shouted through a megaphone or printed on a
poster in letters six foot high  that here was the world of plot within
plot  crossing and double crossing  of lies and graft and stabbing in
the back  of murder and a contemptuous guffaw for the fool who lost the
game  feverstones guffaw  that day he had called him an “incurable
romantic ” came back to his mind  feverstone       that was how he had
come to believe in wither  on feverstones recommendation  apparently
his folly went further back  how on earth had he come to trust
feverstone—a man with a mouth like a shark  with his flash manners  a
man who never looked you in the face  jane  or dimble  would have seen
through him at once  he had “crook” written all over him  he was fit
only to deceive puppets like curry and busby  but then  at the time when
he first met feverstone  he had not thought curry and busby puppets 
with extraordinary clarity  but with renewed astonishment  he remembered
how he had felt about the progressive element at bracton when he was
first admitted to its confidence  he remembered  even more
incredulously  how he had felt as a very junior fellow while he was
outside it—how he had looked almost with awe at the heads of curry and
busby bent close together in common room  hearing occasional fragments
of their whispered conversation  pretending himself the while to be
absorbed in a periodical but longing—oh  so intensely longing—for one of
them to cross the room and speak to him  and then  after months and
months  it had happened  he had a picture of himself  the odious little
outsider who wanted to be an insider  the infantile gull  drinking in
the husky and unimportant confidences  as if he were being admitted to
the government of the planet  was there  no  beginning to his folly  had
he been an utter fool all through from the very day of his birth  even
as a schoolboy  when he had ruined his work and half broken his heart
trying to get into the society called grip  and lost his only real
friend in doing so  even as a child  fighting myrtle because she  would 
go and talk secrets with pamela next door 

he himself did not understand why all this  which was now so clear  had
never previously crossed his mind  he was unaware that such thoughts had
often knocked for entrance  but had always been excluded for the very
good reason that if they were once entertained it involved ripping up
the whole web of his life  cancelling almost every decision his will had
ever made  and really beginning over again as though he were an infant 
the indistinct mass of problems which would have to be faced if he
admitted such thoughts  the innumerable “somethings” about which
“something” would have to be done  had deterred him from ever raising
these questions  what had now taken the blinkers off was the fact that
nothing  could  be done  they were going to hang him  his story was at
an end  there was no harm in ripping up the web now for he was not going
to use it any more  there was no bill to be paid  in the shape of
arduous decision and reconstruction  for truth  it was a result of the
approach of death which the deputy director and professor frost had
possibly not foreseen 

there were no moral considerations at this moment in marks mind  he
looked back on his life  not with shame but with a kind of disgust at
its dreariness  he saw himself as a little boy in short trousers  hidden
in the shrubbery beside the paling to overhear myrtles conversation
with pamela  and trying to ignore the fact that it was not at all
interesting when overheard  he saw himself making believe that he
enjoyed those sunday afternoons with the athletic heroes of grip  while
all the time  as he now saw  he was almost homesick for one of the old
walks with pearson—pearson whom he had taken such pains to leave behind 
he saw himself in his teens laboriously reading rubbishy grown-up novels
and drinking beer when he really enjoyed john buchan and stone ginger 
the hours that he had spent learning the very slang of each new circle
that attracted him  the perpetual assumption of interest in things he
found dull and of knowledge he did not possess  the almost heroic
sacrifice of nearly every person and thing he actually enjoyed  the
miserable attempt to pretend that one  could  enjoy grip  or the
progressive element  or the n i c e —all this came over him with a kind
of heartbreak  when had he ever done what he wanted  mixed with the
people whom he liked  or even eaten and drunk what took his fancy  the
concentrated insipidity of it all filled him with self-pity 

in his normal condition  explanations that laid on impersonal forces
outside himself the responsibility for all this life of dust and broken
bottles would have occurred at once to his mind and been at once
accepted  it would have been “the system” or “an inferiority complex”
due to his parents  or the peculiarities of the age  none of these
things occurred to him now  his “scientific” outlook had never been a
real philosophy believed with blood and heart  it had lived only in his
brain  and was a part of that public self which was now falling off him 
he was aware  without even having to think of it  that it was he
himself—nothing else in the whole universe—that had chosen the dust and
broken bottles  the heap of old tin cans  the dry and choking places 

an unexpected idea came into his head  this—this death of his—would be
lucky for jane  myrtle long ago  pearson at school  denniston while they
were undergraduates  and lastly jane had been the four biggest invasions
of his life by something from beyond the dry and choking places  myrtle
he had conquered by becoming the clever brother who won scholarships and
mixed with important people  they were really twins  but after a short
period in childhood during which she had appeared as an elder sister 
she had become more like a younger sister and had remained so ever
since  he had wholly drawn her into his orbit  it was her large
wondering eyes and naïf answers to his accounts of the circle he was now
moving in which had provided at each stage most of the real pleasure of
his career  but for the same reason she had ceased to mediate life from
beyond the dry places  the flower  once safely planted among the tin
cans  had turned into a tin can itself  pearson and denniston he had
thrown away  and he now knew  for the first time  what he had secretly
meant to do with jane  if all had succeeded  if he had become the sort
of man he hoped to be  she was to have been the great hostess—the secret
hostess in the sense that only the very esoteric few would know who that
striking-looking woman was and why it mattered so enormously to secure
her good will  well       it was lucky for jane  she seemed to him  as
he now thought of her  to have in herself deep wells and knee-deep
meadows of happiness  rivers of freshness  enchanted gardens of leisure 
which he could not enter but could have spoiled  she was one of those
other people—like pearson  like denniston  like the dimbles—who could
enjoy things for their own sake  she was not like him  it was well that
she should be rid of him  of course she would get over it  she had tried
to do her best  but she didnt really care for him  nobody ever had 
much 

at that moment came the sound of a key turning in the lock of the
cell-door  instantly all these thoughts vanished  mere physical terror
of death  drying the throat  rushed back upon him  he scrambled to his
feet and stood with his back against the farthest wall  staring as hard
as if he could escape hanging by keeping whoever entered steadily in
sight 

it was not a policeman who came in  it was a man in a grey suit whose
pince-nez  as he glanced towards mark and towards the light  became
opaque windows concealing his eyes  mark knew him at once and knew that
he was at belbury  it was not this that made him open his own eyes even
wider and almost forget his terror in his astonishment  it was the
change in the mans appearance—or rather the change in the eyes with
which mark saw him  in one sense everything about professor frost was as
it had always been—the pointed beard  the extreme whiteness of forehead 
the regularity of features  and the bright arctic smile  but what mark
could not understand was how he had ever managed to overlook something
about the man so obvious that any child would have shrunk away from him
and any dog would have backed into the corner with raised hackles and
bared teeth  death itself did not seem more frightening than the fact
that only six hours ago he would in some measure have trusted this man 
welcomed his confidence  and even made believe that his society was not
disagreeable 




                                 twelve
                          wet and windy night 


                                   i

“well ” said dimble  “theres no one here ”

“he was here a moment ago ” said denniston 

“youre sure you  did  see someone ” said dimble 

“i thought i saw someone ” said denniston  “im not positive ”

“if there was anyone he must still be quite close ” said dimble 

“what about giving him a call ” suggested denniston 

“hush  listen ” said jane  they were all silent for a few moments 

“thats only the old donkey ” said dimble presently  “moving about at
the top ”

there was another silence 

“he seems to have been pretty extravagant with his matches ” said
denniston presently  glancing at the trodden earth in the firelight 
“one would expect a tramp——”

“on the other hand ” said dimble  “one would not expect merlin to have
brought a box of matches with him from the fifth century ”

“but what are we to  do  ” said jane 

“one hardly likes to think what macphee will say if we return with no
more success than this  he will at once point out a plan we ought to
have followed ” said denniston with a smile 

“now that the rains over ” said dimble  “wed better get back to the
car and start hunting for your white gate  what are you looking at 
denniston ”

“im looking at this mud ” said denniston  who had moved a few paces
away from the fire and in the direction of the path by which they had
descended into the dingle  he had been stooping and using his torch  now
he suddenly straightened himself  “look ” he said  “there have been
several people here  no  dont walk onto it and mess up all the tracks 
look  cant you see  sir ”

“arent they our own footprints ” said dimble 

“some of them are pointing the wrong way  look at that—and that ”

“might they be the tramp himself ” said dimble  “if it was a tramp ”

“he couldnt have walked up that path without our seeing him ” said
jane 

“unless he did it before we arrived ” said denniston 

“but we all saw him ” said jane 

“come ” said dimble  “lets follow them up to the top  i dont suppose
we shall be able to follow them far  if not  we must get back to the
road and go on looking for the gate ”

as they reached the lip of the hollow  mud changed into grass under foot
and the footprints disappeared  they walked twice round the dingle and
found nothing  then they set out to return to the road  it had turned
into a fine night  orion dominated the whole sky 


                                   ii

the deputy director hardly ever slept  when it became absolutely
necessary for him to do so  he took a drug  but the necessity was rare 
for the mode of consciousness he experienced at most hours of day or
night had long ceased to be exactly like what other men call waking  he
had learned to withdraw most of his consciousness from the task of
living  to conduct business  even  with only a quarter of his mind 
colours  tastes  smells  and tactual sensations no doubt bombarded his
physical senses in the normal manner  they did not now reach his ego 
the manner and outward attitude to men which he had adopted half a
century ago were now an organisation which functioned almost
independently  like a gramophone  and to which he could hand over his
whole routine of interviews and committees  while the brain and lips
carried on this work  and built up day by day for those around him the
vague and formidable personality which they knew so well  his inmost
self was free to pursue its own life  that detachment of the spirit not
only from the senses but even from the reason which has been the goal of
some mystics was now his 

hence he was still  in a sense  awake—that is  he was certainly not
sleeping—an hour after frost had left him to visit mark in his cell 
anyone who had looked into the study during that hour would have seen
him sitting motionless at his table  with bowed head and folded hands 
but his eyes were not shut  the face had no expression  the real man was
far away  suffering  enjoying  or inflicting whatever such souls do
suffer  enjoy  or inflict when the cord that binds them to the natural
order is stretched out to its utmost but not yet snapped  when the
telephone rang at his elbow he took up the receiver without a start 

“speaking ” he said 

“this is stone  sir ” came a voice  “we have found the chamber ”

“yes ”

“it was empty  sir ”

“empty ”

“yes  sir ”

“are you sure  my dear mr  stone  that you have found the right place 
it is possible      ”

“oh yes  sir  it is a little kind of crypt  stonework and some roman
brick  and a kind of slab in the middle  like an altar or a bed ”

“and am i to understand there was no one there  no sign of occupation ”

“well  sir  it seemed to us to have been recently disturbed ”

“pray be as explicit as possible  mr  stone ”

“well  sir  there was an exit—i mean a tunnel  leading out of it to the
south  we went up this tunnel at once  it comes out about eight hundred
yards away  outside the area of the wood ”

“comes out  do you mean there is an arch—a gate—a tunnel mouth ”

“well  thats just the point  we got out to the open air all right  but
obviously something had been smashed-up there quite recently  it looked
as if it had been done by explosives  as if the end of the tunnel had
been walled up and had some depth of earth on top of it  and as if
someone had recently blasted his way out  there was no end of a mess ”

“continue  mr  stone  what did you do next ”

“i used the order you had given me  sir  to collect all the police
available and have sent off search-parties for the man you described ”

“i see  and how did  you  describe him to them ”

“just as you did  sir  an old man with either a very long beard or a
beard very roughly trimmed  probably in a mantle  but certainly in some
kind of unusual clothes  it occurred to me at the last moment to add
that he might have no clothes at all ”

“why did you add that  mr  stone ”

“well  sir  i didnt know how long hed been there  and it isnt my
business  id heard things about clothes preserved in a place like that
and all falling to pieces as soon as the air was admitted  i hope you
wont imagine for a moment that im trying to find out anything you
dont choose to tell me  but i just thought it would be as well
to      ”

“you were quite right  mr  stone ” said wither  “in thinking that
anything remotely resembling inquisitiveness on your part might have the
most disastrous consequences  i mean  for yourself  for  of course  it
is your interests i have chiefly had in view in my choice of methods  i
assure you that you can rely on my support in the very—er—delicate
position you have—no doubt unintentionally—chosen to occupy ”

“thank you very much  sir  i am so glad you think i was right in saying
he might be naked ”

“oh  as to  that  ” said the director  “there are a great many
considerations which cannot be raised at the moment  and what did you
instruct your search-parties to do on finding any such—er—person ”

“well  that was another difficulty  sir  i sent my own assistant  father
doyle  with one party  because he knows latin  and i gave inspector
wrench the ring you gave me and put him in charge of the second  the
best i could do for the third party was to see that it contained someone
who knew welsh ”

“you did not think of accompanying a party yourself ”

“no  sir  youd told me to ring up without fail the moment we found
anything  and i didnt want to delay the search-parties until id got
you ”

“i see  well  no doubt your action  speaking quite without prejudice 
could be interpreted along those lines  you made it quite clear that
this—ah—personage—when found  was to be treated with the greatest
deference and—if you wont misunderstand me—caution ”

“oh yes  sir ”

“well  mr  stone  i am  on the whole  and with certain inevitable
reservations  moderately satisfied with your conduct of this affair  i
believe that i may be able to present it in a favourable light to those
of my colleagues whose good will you have  unfortunately  not been able
to retain  if you can bring it to a successful conclusion you would very
much strengthen your position  if not       it is inexpressibly painful
to me that there should be these tensions and mutual recriminations
among us  but you quite understand me  my dear boy  if only i could
persuade—say miss hardcastle and mr  studdock—to share my appreciation
of your very real qualities  you would need to have no apprehensions
about your career or—ah—your security ”

“but what do you want me to  do   sir ”

“my dear young friend  the golden rule is very simple  there are only
two errors which would be fatal to one placed in the peculiar situation
which certain parts of your previous conduct have unfortunately created
for you  on the one hand  anything like a lack of initiative or
enterprise would be disastrous  on the other  the slightest approach to
unauthorised action—anything which suggested that you were assuming a
liberty of decision which  in all the circumstances  is not really
yours—might have consequences from which even i could not protect you 
but as long as you keep quite clear of these two extremes  there is no
reason  speaking unofficially  why you should not be perfectly safe ”

then  without waiting for mr  stone to reply  he hung up the receiver
and rang his bell

“oughtnt we to be nearly at the gate we climbed over ” said dimble 

it was a good deal lighter now that the rain had stopped  but the wind
had risen and was roaring about them so that only shouted remarks could
be heard  the branches of the hedge beside which they were tramping
swayed and dipped and rose again so that they looked as if they were
lashing the bright stars 

“its a good deal longer than i remembered ” said denniston 

“but not so muddy ” said jane 

“youre right ” said denniston  suddenly stopping  “its all stony  it
wasnt like this at all on the way up  were in the wrong field ”

“i  think  ” said dimble mildly  “we must be right  we turned half left
along this hedge as soon as we came out of the trees  and im sure i
remember——”

“but did we come out of the copse on the right side ” said denniston 

“if we once start changing course ” said dimble  “we shall go round and
round in circles all night  lets keep straight on  were bound to come
to the road in the end ”

“hullo ” said jane sharply  “whats this ”

all listened  because of the wind  the unidentified rhythmic noise which
they were straining to hear seemed quite distant at one moment  and
then  next moment  with shouts of “look out ”—“go away you great
brute ”—“get back”—and the like  all were shrinking back into the hedge
as the  plosh-plosh  of a horse cantering on soft ground passed close
beside them  a cold gobbet of mud flung up from its hoofs struck
denniston in the face 

“oh  look  look ” cried jane  “stop him  quick ”

“stop him ” said denniston who was trying to clean his face  “what on
earth for  the less i see of that great clod-hopping quadruped  the
better——”

“oh  shout out to him  dr  dimble ” said jane  in an agony of
impatience  “come on  run  didnt you see ”

“see what ” panted dimble  as the whole party  under the influence of
janes urgency  began running in the direction of the retreating horse 

“theres a man on his back ” gasped jane  she was tired and out of
breath and had lost a shoe 

“a man ” said denniston  and then  “by god  sir  janes right  look 
look there  against the sky       to your left ”

“we cant overtake him ” said dimble 

“hi  stop  come back  friends— amis — amici  ” bawled denniston 

dimble was not able to shout for the moment  he was an old man  who had
been tired before they set out  and now his heart and lungs were doing
things to him of which his doctor had told him the meaning some years
ago  he was not frightened  but he could not shout with a great voice
 least of all in the old solar language  until he had breathed  and
while he stood trying to fill his lungs all the others suddenly cried
“look” yet again  for high among the stars  looking unnaturally large
and many legged  the shape of the horse appeared as it leaped a hedge
some twenty yards away  and on its back  with some streaming garment
blown far out behind him in the wind  the great figure of a man  it
seemed to jane that he was looking back over his shoulder as though he
mocked  then came a splash and thud as the horse alighted on the far
side  and then nothing but wind and starlight again

“you are in danger ” said frost  when he had finished locking the door
of marks cell  “but you are also within reach of a great opportunity ”

“i gather ” said mark  “i am at the institute after all and not in a
police station ”

“yes  that makes no difference to the danger  the institute will soon
have official powers of liquidation  it has anticipated them  hingest
and carstairs have both been liquidated  such actions are demanded of
us ”

“if you are going to kill me ” said mark  “why all this farce of a
murder charge ”

“before going on ” said frost  “i must ask you to be strictly objective 
resentment and fear are both chemical phenomena  our reactions to one
another are chemical phenomena  social relations are chemical relations 
you must observe these feelings in yourself in an objective manner  do
not let them distract your attention from the facts ”

“i see ” said mark  he was acting while he said it—trying to sound at
once faintly hopeful and slightly sullen  ready to be worked upon  but
within  his new insight into belbury kept him resolved not to believe
one word the other said  not to accept  though he might feign
acceptance  any offer he made  he felt that he must at all costs hold on
to the knowledge that these men were unalterable enemies  for already he
felt the old tug towards yielding  towards semi-credulity  inside him 

“the murder charge against you and the alternations in your treatment
have been part of a planned programme with a well-defined end in view ”
said frost  “it is a discipline through which everyone is passed before
admission to the circle ”

again mark felt a spasm of retrospective terror  only a few days ago he
would have swallowed any hook with that bait on it  and nothing but the
imminence of death could have made the hook so obvious and the bait so
insipid as it now was  at least  so comparatively insipid  for even
now      

“i dont quite see the purpose of it ” he said aloud 

“it is  again  to promote objectivity  a circle bound together by
subjective feelings of mutual confidence and liking would be useless 
those  as i have said  are chemical phenomena  they could all  in
principle  be produced by injections  you have been made to pass through
a number of conflicting feelings about the deputy director and others in
order that your future association with us may not be based on feelings
at all  in so far as there must be social relations between members of
the circle it is  perhaps  better that they should be feelings of
dislike  there is less risk of their being confused with the real
 nexus  ”

“my future association ” said studdock  acting a tremulous eagerness 
but it was perilously easy for him to act it  the reality might reawake
at any moment 

“yes ” said frost  “you have been selected as a possible candidate for
admission  if you do not gain admission  or if you reject it  it will be
necessary to destroy you  i am not  of course  attempting to work on
your fears  they only confuse the issue  the process would be quite
painless  and your present reactions to it are inevitable physical
events ”

“it—it seems rather a formidable decision ” said mark 

“that is merely a proposition about the state of your own body at the
moment  if you please  i will go on to give you the necessary
information  i must begin by telling you that neither the deputy
director  nor i  are responsible for shaping the policy of the
institute ”

“the head ” said mark 

“no  filostrato and wilkins are quite deceived about the head  they
have  indeed  carried out a remarkable experiment by preserving it from
decay  but alcasans mind is not the mind we are in contact with when
the head speaks ”

“do you mean alcasan is really        dead  ” asked mark  his surprise
at frosts last statement needed no acting 

“in the present state of our knowledge ” said frost  “there is no answer
to that question  probably it has no meaning  but the cortex and vocal
organs in alcasans head are used by a different mind  and now  please 
attend very carefully  you have probably not heard of macrobes ”

“microbes ” said mark in bewilderment  “but of course——”

“i did not say  microbes   i said  macrobes   the formation of the word
explains itself  below the level of animal life we have long known that
there are microscopic organisms  their actual results on human life  in
respect of health and disease  have  of course  made up a large part of
history  the secret cause was not known till we invented the
microscope ”

“go on ” said mark  ravenous curiosity was moving like a sort of
ground-swell beneath his conscious determination to stand on guard 

“i have now to inform you that there are similar organisms  above  the
level of animal life  when i say “above” i am not speaking biologically 
the structure of the macrobe  so far as we know it  is of extreme
simplicity  when i say that it is above the animal level  i mean that it
is more permanent  disposes of more energy  and has greater
intelligence ”

“more intelligent than the highest anthropoids ” said mark  “it must be
pretty nearly human  then ”

“you have misunderstood me  when i said it transcended the animals  i
was  of course  including the most efficient animal  man  the  macrobe 
is more intelligent than man ”

“but how is it in that case that we have had no communication with
them ”

“it is not certain that we have not  but in primitive times it was
spasmodic  and was opposed by numerous prejudices  moreover the
intellectual development of man had not reached the level at which
intercourse with our species could offer any attractions to a  macrobe  
but though there has been little intercourse  there has been profound
influence  their effect on human history has been far greater than that
of the microbes  though  of course  equally unrecognised  in the light
of what we now know all history will have to be rewritten  the real
causes of all the principal events are quite unknown to the historians 
that  indeed  is why history has not yet succeeded in becoming a
science ”

“i think ill sit down  if you dont mind ” said mark  resuming his seat
on the floor  frost remained  throughout the whole conversation 
standing perfectly still with his arms hanging down straight at his
sides  but for the periodic upward tilt of his head and flash of his
teeth at the end of a sentence  he used no gestures 

“the vocal organs and brain taken from alcasan ” he continued  “have
become the conductors of a regular intercourse between the macrobes and
our own species  i do not say that we have discovered this technique 
the discovery was theirs  not ours  the circle to which you may be
admitted is the organ of that co-operation between the two species which
has already created a new situation for humanity  the change  you will
see  is far greater than that which turned the sub-man into the man  it
is more comparable to the first appearance of organic life ”

“these organisms  then ” said mark  “are friendly to humanity ”

“if you reflect for a moment ” said frost  “you will see that your
question has no meaning except on the level of the crudest popular
thought  friendship is a chemical phenomenon  so is hatred  both of them
presupposes organisms of our own type  the first step towards
intercourse with the macrobes is the realisation that one must go
outside the whole world of our subjective emotions  it is only as you
begin to do so that you discover how much of what you mistook for your
thought was merely a by-product of your blood and nervous tissues ”

“oh  of course  i didnt quite mean friendly in that sense  i really
meant  were their aims compatible with our own ”

“what do you mean by our own aims ”

“well—i suppose—the scientific reconstruction of the human race in the
direction of increased efficiency—the elimination of war and poverty and
other forms of waste—a fuller exploitation of nature—the preservation
and extension of our species  in fact ”

“i do not think this pseudo-scientific language really modifies the
essentially subjective and instinctive basis of the ethics you are
describing  i will return to the matter at a later stage  for the
moment  i would merely remark that your view of war and your reference
to the preservation of the species suggest a profound misconception 
they are mere generalisations from affectional feelings ”

“surely ” said mark  “one requires a pretty large population for the
full exploitation of nature  if for nothing else  and surely war is
disgenic and reduces efficiency  even if population needs thinning  is
not war the worst possible method of thinning it ”

“that idea is a survival from conditions which are rapidly being
altered  a few centuries ago  war did operate in the way you describe  a
large agricultural population was essential  and war destroyed types
which were then still useful  but every advance in industry and
agriculture reduces the number of work-people who are required  a large 
unintelligent population is now becoming a dead-weight  the real
importance of scientific war is that scientists have to be reserved  it
was not the great technocrats of koenigsberg or moscow who supplied the
casualties in the siege of stalingrad  it was superstitious bavarian
peasants and low-grade russian agricultural workers  the effect of
modern war is to eliminate retrogressive types  while sparing the
technocracy and increasing its hold upon public affairs  in the new age 
what has hitherto been merely the intellectual nucleus of the race is to
become  by gradual stages  the race itself  you are to conceive the
species as an animal which has discovered how to simplify nutrition and
locomotion to such a point that the old complex organs and the large
body which contained them are no longer necessary  that large body is
therefore to disappear  only a tenth part of it will now be needed to
support the brain  the individual is to become all head  the human race
is to become all technocracy ”

“i see ” said mark  “i had thought—rather vaguely—that the intelligent
nucleus would be extended by education ”

“that is a pure chimera  the great majority of the human race can be
educated only in the sense of being given knowledge  they cannot be
trained into the total objectivity of mind which is now necessary  they
will always remain animals  looking at the world through the haze of
their subjective reactions  even if they could  the day for a large
population has passed  it has served its function by acting as a kind of
cocoon for technocratic and objective man  now  the macrobes  and the
selected humans who can co-operate with them  have no further use for
it ”

“the last two wars  then  were not disasters in your view ”

“on the contrary  they were simply the beginning of the programme—the
first two of the sixteen major wars which are scheduled to take place in
this century  i am aware of the emotional  that is  the chemical 
reactions which a statement like this produces in you  and you are
wasting your time in trying to conceal them from me  i do not expect you
to control them  that is not the path to objectivity  i deliberately
raise them in order that you may become accustomed to regard them in a
purely scientific light and distinguish them as sharply as possible from
the  facts  ”

mark sat with his eyes fixed on the floor  he had felt  in fact  very
little emotion at frosts programme for the human race  indeed he almost
discovered at that moment how little he had ever really cared for those
remote futures and universal benefits whereon his co-operation with the
institute had at first been theoretically based  certainly at the
present moment there was no room in his mind for such considerations  he
was fully occupied with the conflict between his resolution not to trust
these men  never again to be lured by any bait into real co-operation 
and the terrible strength—like a tide sucking at the shingle as it goes
out—of an opposite emotion  for here  here surely at last  so his desire
whispered him  was the true inner circle of all  the circle whose centre
was outside the human race—the ultimate secret  the supreme power  the
last initiation  the fact that it was almost completely horrible did not
in the least diminish its attraction  nothing that lacked the tang of
horror would have been quite strong enough to satisfy the delirious
excitement which now set his temples hammering  it came into his mind
that frost knew all about this excitement  and also about the opposite
determination  and reckoned securely on the excitement as something
which was certain to carry the day in his victims mind 

a rattling and knocking which had been obscurely audible for some time
now became so loud that frost turned to the door  “go away ” he said 
raising his voice  “what is the meaning of this impertinence ” the
indistinct noise of someone shouting on the other side of the door was
heard  and the knocking went on  frosts smile widened as he turned and
opened it  instantly a piece of paper was put into his hand  as he read
it  he started violently  without glancing at mark  he left the cell 
mark heard the door locked again behind him 


                                   v

“what friends those two are ” said ivy maggs  she was referring to pinch
the cat and mr  bultitude the bear  the latter was sitting up with his
back against the warm wall by the kitchen fire  his cheeks were so fat
and his eyes so small that he looked as if he were smiling  the cat
after walking to and fro with erected tail and rubbing herself against
his belly had finally curled up and gone to sleep between his legs  the
jackdaw  still on the directors shoulder  had long since put its head
beneath its wing 

mrs  dimble  who sat farther back in the kitchen  darning as if for dear
life  pursed her lips a little as ivy maggs spoke  she could not go to
bed  she wished they would all keep quiet  her anxiety had reached that
pitch at which almost every event  however small  threatens to become an
irritation  but then  if anyone had been watching her expression  they
would have seen the little grimace rapidly smoothed out again  her will
had many years of practice behind it 

“when we use the word friends of those two creatures ” said macphee  “i
doubt we are being merely anthropomorphic  it is difficult to avoid the
illusion that they have personalities in the human sense  but theres no
evidence for it ”

“whats she go making up to him for  then ” asked ivy 

“well ” said macphee  “maybe thered be a desire for warmth—shes away
in out of the draught there  and thered be a sense of security from
being near something familiar  and likely enough some obscure
transferred sexual impulses ”

“really  mr  macphee ” said ivy with great indignation  “its a shame
for you to say those things about two dumb animals  im sure i never did
see pinch—or mr  bultitude either  the poor thing——”

“i said  transferred  ” interrupted macphee drily  “and anyway  they
like the mutual friction of their fur as a means of rectifying
irritations set up by parasites  now  youll observe——”

“if you mean they have fleas ” said ivy  “you know as well as anyone
that they have no such thing ” she had reason on her side  for it was
macphee himself who put on overalls once a month and solemnly lathered
mr  bultitude from rump to snout in the wash-house and poured buckets of
tepid water over him  and finally dried him—a days work in which he
allowed no one to assist him 

“what do you think  sir ” said ivy  looking at the director 

“me ” said ransom  “i think macphee is introducing into animal life a
distinction that doesnt exist there  and then trying to determine on
which side of that distinction the feelings of pinch and bultitude fall 
youve got to become human before the physical cravings are
distinguishable from affections—just as you have to become spiritual
before affections are distinguishable from charity  what is going on in
the cat and the bear isnt one or other of these two things  it is a
single undifferentiated thing in which you can find the germ of what we
call friendship and of what we call physical need  but it isnt either
at that level  it is one of barfields ancient unities ”

“i never denied they liked being together ” said macphee 

“well  thats what i said ” shouted mrs  maggs 

“the question is worth raising  mr  director ” said macphee  “because i
submit that it points to an essential falsity in the whole system of
this place ”

grace ironwood who had been sitting with her eyes half closed suddenly
opened them wide and fixed them on the ulsterman  and mrs  dimble leaned
her head towards camilla and said in a whisper  “i do wish mr  macphee
could be persuaded to go to bed  its perfectly unbearable at a time
like this ”

“how do you mean  macphee ” asked the director 

“i mean that there is a half-hearted attempt to adopt an attitude
towards irrational creatures which cannot be consistently maintained 
and ill do the justice to say that youve never tried  the bear is kept
in the house and given apples and golden syrup till its near
bursting——”

“well  i like that ” said mrs  maggs  “who is it thats always giving
him apples  thats what id like to know ”

“the bear  as i was observing ” said macphee  “is kept in the house and
pampered  the pigs are kept in a stye and killed for bacon  i would be
interested to know the philosophical  rationale  of the distinction ”

ivy maggs looked in bewilderment from the smiling face of the director
to the unsmiling face of macphee 

“i think its just silly ” she said  “who ever heard of trying to make
bacon out of a bear ”

macphee made a little stamp of impatience and said something which was
drowned first by ransoms laughter and then by a great clap of wind
which shook the window as if it would blow it in 

“what a dreadful night for them ” said mrs  dimble 

“i love it ” said camilla  “id love to be out in it  out on a high
hill  oh  i do wish youd let me go with them  sir ”

“you  like  it ” said ivy  “oh  i dont  listen to it round the corner
of the house  itd make me feel kind of creepy if i were alone  or even
if you was upstairs  sir  i always think its on nights like this that
they—you know—come to you ”

“they dont take any notice of weather one way or the other  ivy ” said
ransom 

“do you know ” said ivy in a low voice  “thats a thing i dont quite
understand  theyre so eerie  these ones that come to visit you  i
wouldnt go near that part of the house if i thought there was anything
there  not if you paid me a hundred pounds  but i dont feel like that
about god  but he ought to be worse  if you see what i mean ”

“he was  once ” said the director  “you are quite right about the
powers  angels in general are not good company for men in general—even
when they are good angels and good men  its all in st  paul  but as for
maleldil himself  all that has changed  it was changed by what happened
at bethlehem ”

“its getting ever so near christmas now ” said ivy  addressing the
company in general 

“we shall have mr  maggs with us before then ” said ransom 

“in a day or two  sir ” said ivy 

“was that only the wind ” said grace ironwood 

“it sounded to me like a horse ” said mrs  dimble 

“here ” said macphee jumping up  “get out of the way  mr  bultitude 
till i get my gum boots  itll be those two horses of broads again 
tramping all over my celery trenches  if only youd let me go to the
police in the first instance  why the man cant keep them shut up
     ”—he was bundling himself into his mackintosh as he spoke the
rest of the speech was inaudible 

“my crutch  please  camilla ” said ransom  “come back  macphee  we will
go to the door together  you and i  ladies  stay where you are ”

there was a look on his face which some of those present had not seen
before  the four women sat as if they had been turned to stone  with
their eyes wide and staring  a moment later ransom and macphee stood
alone in the scullery  the back door was so shaking on its hinges with
the wind that they did not know whether someone were knocking at it or
not 

“now ” said ransom  “open it  and stand back behind it yourself ”

for a second macphee worked with the bolts  then  whether he meant to
disobey or not  a point which must remain doubtful  the storm flung the
door against the wall and he was momentarily pinned behind it  ransom 
standing motionless  leaning forward on his crutch  saw in the light
from the scullery  outlined against the blackness  a huge horse  all in
a lather of sweat and foam  its yellow teeth laid bare  its nostrils
wide and red  its ears flattened against its skull  and its eyes
flaming  it had been ridden so close up to the door that its front hoofs
rested on the doorstep  it had neither saddle  stirrup nor bridle  but
at that very moment a man leapt off its back  he seemed both very tall
and very fat  almost a giant  his reddish-grey hair and beard were blown
all about his face so that it was hardly visible  and it was only after
he had taken a step forward that ransom noticed his clothes—the ragged 
ill-fitting khaki coat  baggy trousers  and boots that had lost the
toes 


                                   vi

in a great room at belbury  where the fire blazed and wine and silver
sparkled on side-tables  and a great bed occupied the centre of the
floor  the deputy director watched in profound silence while four young
men with reverential or medical heedfulness carried in a burden on a
stretcher  as they removed the blankets and transferred the occupant of
the stretcher to the bed  withers mouth opened wider  his interest
became so intense that for the moment the chaos of his face appeared
ordered and he looked like an ordinary man  what he saw was a naked
human body  alive  but apparently unconscious  he ordered the attendants
to place hot-water bottles at its feet and raise the head with pillows 
when they had done so and withdrawn he drew a chair to the foot of the
bed and sat down to study the face of the sleeper  the head was very
large  though perhaps it looked larger than it was because of the
unkempt grey beard and the long and tangled grey hair  the face was
weather-beaten in the extreme and the neck  where visible  already lean
and scraggy with age  the eyes were shut and the lips wore a very slight
smile  the total effect was ambiguous  wither gazed at it for a long
time and sometimes moved his head to see how it looked from a different
angle—almost as if he searched for some trait he could not find and were
disappointed  for nearly a quarter of an hour he sat thus  then the door
opened and professor frost came softly into the room 

he walked to the bedside  bent down and looked closely into the
strangers face  then he walked round to the far side of the bed and did
the same 

“is he asleep ” whispered wither 

“i think not  it is more like some kind of trance  what kind i dont
know ”

“you have no doubts  i trust ”

“where did they find him ”

“in a dingle about quarter of a mile from the entrance to the
 souterrain   they had the track of bare feet almost all the way ”

“the  souterrain  itself was empty ”

“yes  i had a report on that from stone shortly after you left me ”

“you will make provision about stone ”

“yes  but what do you think ”—he pointed with his eyes to the bed 

“i think it is he ” said frost  “the place is right  the nudity is hard
to account for on any other hypothesis  the skull is the kind i
expected ”

“but the face ”

“yes  there are certain traits which are a little disquieting ”

“i could have sworn ” said wither  “that i knew the look of a
master—even the look of one who could be made into a master  you
understand me       one sees at once that straik or studdock might do 
that miss hardcastle  with all her excellent qualities  would not ”

“yes  perhaps we must be prepared for great crudities in        him  
who knows what the technique of the atlantean circle was really like ”

“certainly  one must not be—ah—narrow-minded  one can suppose that the
masters of that age were not quite so sharply divided from the common
people as we are  all sorts of emotional and even instinctive  elements
were perhaps still tolerated in the great atlantean which we have had to
discard ”

“one not only  may  suppose it  one  must   we should not forget that
the whole plan consists in the reunion of different kinds of the art ”

“exactly  perhaps ones association with the powers—their different time
scale and all that—tends to make one forget how enormous the gap in time
is by our human standards ”

“what we have here ” said frost  pointing to the sleeper  “is not  you
see  something from the fifth century  it is the last vestige  surviving
into the fifth century  of something much more remote  something that
comes down from long before the great disaster  even from before
primitive druidism  something that takes us back to numinor  to
pre-glacial periods ”

“the whole experiment is perhaps more hazardous than we realised ”

“i have had occasion before ” said frost  “to express the wish that you
would not keep on introducing these emotional pseudo-statements into our
scientific discussions ”

“my dear friend ” said wither  without looking at him  “i am quite aware
that the subject you mention has been discussed between you and the
powers themselves  quite aware  and i dont doubt that you are equally
well aware of certain discussions they have held with me about aspects
of your own methods which are open to criticism  nothing would be more
futile—i might say more dangerous—than any attempt to introduce between
ourselves those modes of oblique discipline which we properly apply to
our inferiors  it is in your own interest that i venture to touch on
this point ”

instead of replying  frost signalled to his companion  both men became
silent  their gaze fixed on the bed  for the sleeper had opened his
eyes 

the opening of the eyes flooded the whole face with meaning  but it was
a meaning they could not interpret  the sleeper seemed to be looking at
them  but they were not quite sure that he saw them  as the seconds
passed withers main impression of the face was its caution  but there
was nothing intense or uneasy about it  it was a habitual  unemphatic
defensiveness which seemed to have behind it years of hard experience 
quietly—perhaps even humorously—endured 

wither rose to his feet  and cleared his throat 

“ magister merline  ” he said  “ sapientissime britonum  secreti
secretorum possessor  incredibili quodam gaudio afficimur quod te domum
nostram accipere nobis—ah—contingit  scito nos etiam haud imperitos esse
magnae artis—et—ut ita dicam       ”[1]

but his voice died away  it was too obvious that the sleeper was taking
no notice of what he said  it was impossible that a learned man of the
sixth century should not know latin  was there  then  some error in his
own pronunciation  but he felt by no means sure that this man could not
understand him  the total lack of curiosity  or even interest  in his
face  suggested rather that he was not listening 

frost took a decanter from the table and poured out a glass of red wine 
he then returned to the bedside  bowed deeply  and handed it to the
stranger  the latter looked at it with an expression that might  or
might not  be interpreted as one of cunning  then he suddenly sat up in
bed  revealing a huge hairy chest and lean  muscular arms  his eyes
turned to the table and he pointed  frost went back to it and touched a
different decanter  the stranger shook his head and pointed again 

“i think ” said wither  “that our very distinguished guest is trying to
indicate the jug  i dont quite know what was provided  perhaps——”

“it contains beer ” said frost 

“well  it is hardly appropriate—still  perhaps  we know so little of the
customs of that age      ”

while he was still speaking frost had filled a pewter mug with beer and
offered it to their guest  for the first time a gleam of interest came
into that cryptic face  the man snatched the mug eagerly  pushed back
his disorderly moustache from his lips  and began to drink  back and
back went the grey head  up and up went the bottom of the tankard  the
moving muscles of the lean throat made the act of drinking visible  at
last the man  having completely inverted the tankard  set it down  wiped
his wet lips with the back of his hand  and heaved a long sigh—the first
sound he had uttered since his arrival  then he turned his attention
once more to the table 

for about twenty minutes the two old men fed him—wither with tremulous
and courtly deference  frost with the deft  noiseless movements of a
trained servant  all sorts of delicacies had been provided  but the
stranger devoted his attention entirely to cold beef  chicken  pickles 
bread  cheese  and butter  the butter he ate neat  off the end of a
knife  he was apparently unacquainted with forks  and took the chicken
bones in both hands to gnaw them  placing them under the pillow when he
had done  his eating was noisy and animal  when he had eaten  he
signalled for a second pint of beer  drank it at two long draughts 
wiped his mouth on the sheet and his nose on his hand  and seemed to be
composing himself for further slumber 

“ ah—er—domine  ” said wither with deprecating urgency  “ nihil magis
mihi displiceret quam tibi ullo modo—ah—molestum esse  attamen  venia
tua       ”[2]

but the man was taking no notice at all  they could not tell whether his
eyes were shut or whether he was still looking at them under half-closed
lids  but clearly he was not intending to converse  frost and wither
exchanged enquiring glances 

“there is no approach to this room  is there ” said frost  “except
through the next one ”

“no ” said wither 

“let us go out there and discuss the situation  we can leave the door
ajar  we shall be able to hear if he stirs ”


                                  vii

when mark found himself left suddenly alone by frost  his first
sensation was an unexpected lightness of heart  it was not that he had
any release from fears about the future  rather  in the very midst of
those fears  a strange sense of liberation had sprung up  the relief of
no longer trying to win these mens confidence  the shuffling off of
miserable hopes  was almost exhilarating  the straight fight  after the
long series of diplomatic failures  was tonic  he might lose the
straight fight  but at least it was now his side against theirs  and he
could talk of “his side” now  already he was with jane and with all she
symbolised  indeed  it was he who was in the front line  jane was almost
a non-combatant       

the approval of ones own conscience is a very heady draught  and
specially for those who are not accustomed to it  within two minutes
mark had passed from that first involuntary sense of liberation to a
conscious attitude of courage  and thence into unrestrained heroics  the
picture of himself as hero and martyr  as jack the giant-killer still
coolly playing his hand even in the giants kitchen  rose up before him 
promising that it could blot out forever those other  and unendurable
pictures of himself which had haunted him for the last few hours  it
wasnt everyone  after all  who could have resisted an invitation like
frosts  an invitation that beckoned you right across the frontiers of
human life       into the something that people had been trying to find
since the beginning of the world       a touch on that infinitely secret
cord which was the real nerve of all history  how it would have
attracted him once 

 would have attracted him once         suddenly  like a thing that
leaped to him across infinite distances with the speed of light  desire
 salt  black  ravenous  unanswerable desire  took him by the throat  the
merest hint will convey to those who have felt it the quality of the
emotion which now shook him  like a dog shaking a rat  for others  no
description perhaps will avail  many writers speak of it in terms of
lust  a description admirably illuminating from within  totally
misleading from without  it has nothing to do with the body  but it is
in two respects like lust as lust shows itself to be in the deepest and
darkest vault of its labyrinthine house  for like lust  it disenchants
the whole universe  everything else that mark had ever felt—love 
ambition  hunger  lust itself—appeared to have been mere milk and water 
toys for children  not worth one throb of the nerves  the infinite
attraction of this dark thing sucked all other passions into itself  the
rest of the world appeared blanched  etiolated  insipid  a world of
white marriages and white masses  dishes without salt  gambling for
counters  he could not now think of jane except in terms of appetite 
and appetite here made no appeal  that serpent  faced with the true
dragon  became a fangless worm  but it was like lust in another respect
also  it is idle to point out to the perverted man the horror of his
perversion  while the fierce fit is on  that horror is the very spice of
his craving  it is ugliness itself that becomes  in the end  the goal of
his lechery  beauty has long since grown too weak a stimulant  and so it
was here  these creatures of which frost had spoken—and he did not doubt
now that they were locally present with him in the cell—breathed death
on the human race and on all joy  not despite this but because of this 
the terrible gravitation sucked and tugged and fascinated him towards
them  never before had he known the frightful strength of the movement
opposite to nature which now had him in its grip  the impulse to reverse
all reluctances and to draw every circle anti-clockwise  the meaning of
certain pictures  of frosts talk about “objectivity ” of the things
done by witches in old times  became clear to him  the image of withers
face rose to his memory  and this time he did not merely loathe it  he
noted  with shuddering satisfaction  the signs it bore of a shared
experience between them  wither also knew  wither understood      

at the same moment it came back to him that he would probably be killed 
as soon as he thought of that  he became once more aware of the cell—the
little hard white empty place with the glaring light  in which he found
himself sitting on the floor  he blinked his eyes  he could not remember
that it had been visible for the last few minutes  where had he been 
his mind was clear now at any rate  this idea of something in common
between him and wither was all nonsense  of course they meant to kill
him in the end unless he could rescue himself by his own wits  what had
he been thinking and feeling while he forgot that 

gradually he realised that he had sustained some sort of attack  and
that he had put up no resistance at all  and with that realisation a
quite new kind of dread entered his mind  though he was theoretically a
materialist  he had all his life believed quite inconsistently  and even
carelessly  in the freedom of his own will  he had seldom made a moral
resolution  and when he had resolved some hours ago to trust the belbury
crew no further  he had taken it for granted that he would be able to do
what he resolved  he knew  to be sure  that he might “change his mind” 
but till he did so  of course he would carry out his plan  it had never
occurred to him that his mind could thus be changed for him  all in an
instant of time  changed beyond recognition  if that sort of thing could
happen       it was unfair  here was a man trying  for the first time in
his life  to do what was obviously the right thing—the thing that jane
and the dimbles and aunt gilly would have approved of  you might have
expected that when a man behaved in that way the universe would back him
up  for the relics of such semi-savage versions of theism as mark had
picked up in the course of his life were stronger in him than he knew 
and he felt  though he would not have put it into words  that it was “up
to” the universe to reward his good resolutions  yet the very first
moment you tried to be good  the universe let you down  it revealed gaps
you had never dreamed of  it invented new laws for the express purpose
of letting you down  that was what you got for your pains 

the cynics  then  were right  but at this thought  he stopped sharply 
some flavour that came with it had given him pause  was this the other
mood beginning again  oh  not that  at any price  he clenched his hands 
no  no  no  he could not stand this much longer  he wanted jane  he
wanted mrs  dimble  he wanted denniston  he wanted somebody or
something  “oh  dont  dont let me go back into it ” he said  and then
louder  “dont  dont ” all that could in any sense be called himself
went into that cry  and the dreadful consciousness of having played his
last card began to turn slowly into a sort of peace  there was nothing
more to be done  unconsciously he allowed his muscles to relax  his
young body was very tired by this time and even the hard floor was
grateful to it  the cell also seemed to be somehow emptied and purged 
as if it  too  were tired after the conflicts it had witnessed—emptied
like a sky after rain  tired like a child after weeping  a dim
consciousness that the night must be nearly ended stole over him  and he
fell asleep 




                                thirteen
            they have pulled down deep heaven on their heads

“stand  stand where you are and tell me your name and business ” said
ransom 

the ragged figure on the threshold tilted its head a little sideways
like one who cannot quite hear  at the same moment the wind from the
opened door had its way with the house  the inner door  between the
scullery and the kitchen  clapped to with a loud bang  isolating the
three men from the women  and a large tin basin fell clattering into the
sink  the stranger took a pace farther into the room 

“ sta  ” said ransom in a great voice  “ in nomine patris et filii et
spiritus sancti  dic mihi qui sis et quam ob causam venenis  ”[3]

the stranger raised his hand and flung back the dripping hair from his
forehead  the light fell full on his face  from which ransom had the
impression of an immense quietness  every muscle of this mans body
seemed as relaxed as if he were asleep  and he stood absolutely still 
each drop of rain from the khaki coat struck the tiled floor exactly
where the drop before it had fallen 

his eyes rested on ransom for a second or two with no particular
interest  then he turned his head to his left  to where the door was
flung back almost against the wall  macphee was concealed behind it 

“come out ” said the stranger  in latin  the words were spoken almost in
a whisper  but so deep that even in that wind-shaken room they made a
kind of vibration  but what surprised ransom much more was the fact that
macphee immediately obeyed  he did not look at ransom but at the
stranger  then  unexpectedly  he gave an enormous yawn  the stranger
looked him up and down and then turned to the director 

“fellow ” he said in latin  “tell the lord of this house that i am
come ” as he spoke  the wind from behind him was whipping the coat about
his legs and blowing his hair over his forehead  but his great mass
stood as if it had been planted like a tree  and he seemed in no hurry 
and the voice  too  was such as one might imagine to be the voice of a
tree  large and slow and patient  drawn up through roots and clay and
gravel from the depths of the earth 

“i am the master here ” said ransom  in the same language 

“to be sure ” answered the stranger  “and yonder whipper-snapper
  mastigia   is without doubt your bishop ” he did not exactly smile 
but a look of disquieting amusement came into his keen eyes  suddenly he
poked his head forward so as to bring his face much nearer to the
directors 

“tell your master that i am come ” he repeated in the same voice as
before 

ransom looked at him without the flicker of an eyelid 

“do you really wish ” he said at last  “that i call upon my masters ”

“a daw that lives in a hermits cell has learned before now to chatter
book-latin ” said the other  “let us hear your calling  mannikin
  homuncio   ”

“i must use another language for it ” said ransom 

“a daw could have greek also in its bill ”

“it is not greek ”

“let us hear your hebrew  then ”

“it is not hebrew ”

“nay ” answered the other with something like a chuckle  a chuckle deep
hidden in his enormous chest and betrayed only by a slight movement of
his shoulders  “if you come to the gabble of barbarians  it will go hard
but i shall out-chatter you  here is excellent sport ”

“it may happen to seem to you the speech of barbarians ” said ransom 
“for it is long since it has been heard  not even in numinor was it
heard in the streets ”

the stranger gave no start and his face remained as quiet as before  if
it did not become quieter  but he spoke with a new interest 

“your masters let you play with dangerous toys ” he said  “tell me 
slave  what is numinor ”

“the true west ” said ransom 

“well      ” said the other  then  after a pause  he added  “you have
little courtesy to guests in this house  it is a cold wind on my back 
and i have been long in bed  you see  i have already crossed the
threshold ”

“i value that at a straw ” said ransom  “shut the door  macphee ” he
added in english  but there was no response  and looking round for the
first time  he saw that macphee had sat down in the one chair which the
scullery contained and was fast asleep 

“what is the meaning of this foolery ” said ransom  looking sharply at
the stranger 

“if you are indeed the master of this house  you have no need to be
told  if not  why should i give account of myself to such as you  do not
fear  your horse-boy will be none the worse ”

“this shall be seen to shortly ” said ransom  “in the meantime  i do not
fear your entering the house  i have more cause to fear your escaping 
shut the door if you will  for you see my foot is hurt ”

the stranger  without ever taking his eyes off ransom  swept back his
left hand behind him  found the door handle  and slammed the door to 
macphee never stirred  “now ” he said  “what of these masters of yours ”

“my masters are the oyéresu ”

“where did you hear that name ” asked the stranger  “or  if you are
truly of the college  why do they dress you like a slave ”

“your own garments ” said ransom  “are not those of a druid ”

“that stroke was well put by ” answered the other  “since you have
knowledge  answer me three questions  if you dare ”

“i will answer them if i can  but as for daring  we shall see ”

the stranger mused for a few seconds  then  speaking in a slightly
sing-song voice  as though he repeated an old lesson  he asked  in two
latin hexameters  the following question 

“who is called sulva  what road does she walk  why is the womb barren on
one side  where are the cold marriages ”

ransom replied  “sulva is she whom mortals call the moon  she walks in
the lowest sphere  the rim of the world that was wasted goes through
her  half of her orb is turned towards us and shares our curse  her
other half looks to deep heaven  happy would he be who could cross that
frontier and see the fields on her farther side  on this side the womb
is barren and the marriages cold  there dwell an accursed people  full
of pride and lust  there when a young man takes a maiden in marriage
they do not lie together  but each lies with a cunningly fashioned image
of the other  made to move and to be warm by devilish arts  for real
flesh will not please them  they are so dainty   delicati   in their
dreams of lust  their real children they fabricate by vile arts in a
secret place ”

“you have answered well ” said the stranger  “i thought there were but
three men in the world that knew this question  but my second may be
harder  where is the ring of arthur the king  what lord has such a
treasure in his house ”

“the ring of the king ” said ransom  “is on arthurs finger where he
sits in the house of kings in the cup-shaped land of abhalljin  beyond
the seas of lur in perelandra  for arthur did not die  but our lord took
him to be in the body till the end of time and the shattering of sulva 
with enoch and elias and moses and melchisedec the king  melchisedec is
he in whose hall the steep-stoned ring sparkles on the forefinger of the
pendragon ”

“well answered ” said the stranger  “in my college it was thought that
only two men in the world knew this  but as for my third question  no
man knew the answer but myself  who shall be pendragon in the time when
saturn descends from his sphere  in what world did he learn war ”

“in the sphere of venus i learned war ” said ransom  “in this age lurga
shall descend  i am the pendragon ”

when he had said this he took a step backwards  for the big man had
begun to move and there was a new look in his eyes  any who had seen
them as they stood thus face to face would have thought that it might
come to fighting at any moment  but the stranger had not moved with
hostile purpose  slowly  ponderously  yet not awkwardly  as though a
mountain sank like a wave  he sank on one knee  and still his face was
almost on a level with the directors 


                                   ii

“this throws a quite unexpected burden on our resources ” said wither to
frost  where they both sat in the outer room with the door ajar  “i must
confess i had not anticipated any serious difficulty about language ”

“we must get a celtic scholar at once ” said frost  “we are regrettably
weak on the philological side  i do not at the moment know who has
discovered most about ancient british  ransom would be the man to advise
us if he were available  i suppose nothing has been heard of him by your
department ”

“i need hardly point out ” said wither  “that dr  ransoms philological
attainments are by no means the only ground on which we are anxious to
find him  if the least trace had been discovered  you may rest assured
that you would have long since had the—ah—gratification of seeing him
here in person ”

“of course  he may not be in the earth at all ”

“i met him once ” said wither  half closing his eyes  “he was a most
brilliant man in his way  a man whose penetrations and intuitions might
have been of infinite value  if he had not embraced the cause of
reaction  it is a saddening reflection——”

“of course ” said frost  interrupting him  “straik knows modern welsh 
his mother was a welsh woman ”

“it would certainly be much more satisfactory ” said wither  “if we
could  so to speak  keep the whole matter in the family  there would be
something very disagreeable to me—and i am sure you would feel the same
way yourself—about introducing a celtic expert from outside ”

“the expert would  of course  be provided for as soon as we could
dispense with his services ” replied frost  “it is the waste of time
that is the trouble  what progress have you made with straik ”

“oh  really excellent ” said the deputy director  “indeed i am almost a
little disappointed  i mean  my pupil is advancing so rapidly that it
may be necessary to abandon an idea which  i confess  rather attracts
me  i had been thinking while you were out of the room that it would be
specially fitting and—ah—proper and gratifying if your pupil and mine
could be initiated together  we should both  i am sure  have felt      
but  of course  if straik is ready some time before studdock  i should
not feel myself entitled to stand in his way  you will understand  my
dear fellow  that i am not trying to make this anything like a test case
as to the comparative efficiency of our very different methods ”

“it would be impossible for you to do so ” said frost  “since i have
interviewed studdock only once  and that one interview has had all the
success that could be expected  i mentioned straik only to find out
whether he were already so far committed that he might properly be
introduced to our guest ”

“oh       as to being  committed  ” said wither  “in some sense      
ignoring certain fine shades for the moment  while fully recognising
their ultimate importance       i should not hesitate       we should be
perfectly justified ”

“i was thinking ” said frost  “that there must be someone on duty here 
he may wake at any moment  our pupils—straik and studdock—could take it
in turns  there is no reason why they should not be useful even before
their full initiation  they would  of course  be under orders to ring us
up the moment anything happened ”

“you think mr —ah—studdock is far enough on ”

“it doesnt matter ” said frost  “what harm can he do  he cant get
 out   and in the meantime we only want someone to watch  it would be a
useful test ”


                                  iii

macphee  who had just been refuting both ransom and alcasans head by a
two-edged argument which seemed unanswerable in the dream but which he
never afterwards remembered  found himself violently waked by someone
shaking his shoulder  he suddenly perceived that he was cold and his
left foot was numb  then he saw dennistons face looking into his own 
the scullery seemed full of people—denniston and dimble and jane  they
appeared extremely bedraggled  torn and muddy and wet 

“are you all right ” denniston was saying  “ive been trying to wake you
for several minutes ”

“all right ” said macphee  swallowing once or twice and licking his
lips  “aye  im all right ” then he sat upright  “theres been a—a man
here ” he said 

“what sort of a man ” asked dimble 

“well ” said macphee  “as to that       its not just so easy       i
fell asleep talking to him  to tell you the truth  i cant just bring to
mind what we were saying ”

the others exchanged glances  though macphee was fond of a little hot
toddy on winter nights  he was a sober man  they had never seen him like
this before  next moment he jumped to his feet 

“lord save us ” he exclaimed  “he had the director here  quick  we must
search the house and the garden  it was some kind of impostor or spy  i
know now whats wrong with me  ive been hypnotised  there was a horse 
too  i mind the horse ”

this last detail had an immediate effect on his hearers  denniston flung
open the kitchen door and the whole party surged in after him  for a
second they saw indistinct forms in the deep  red light of a large fire
which had not been attended to for some hours  then  as denniston found
the switch and turned on the light  all drew a deep breath  the four
women sat fast asleep  the jackdaw slept  perched on the back of an
empty chair  mr  bultitude  stretched out on his side across the hearth 
slept also  his tiny  child-like snore  so disproportionate to his bulk 
was audible in the momentary silence  mrs  dimble  bunched in what
seemed a comfortless position  was sleeping with her head on the table 
a half-darned sock still clasped on her knees  dimble looked at her with
that uncurable pity which men feel for any sleeper  but specially for a
wife  camilla  who had been in the rocking-chair  was curled up in an
attitude which was full of grace  like that of an animal accustomed to
sleep anywhere  mrs  maggs slept with her kind  commonplace mouth wide
open  and grace ironwood  bolt upright as if she were awake  but with
the head sagging a little to one side  seemed to submit with austere
patience to the humiliation of unconsciousness 

“theyre all right ” said macphee from behind  “its just the same as he
did to me  weve no time to wake them  get on ”

they passed from the kitchen into the flagged passage  to all of them
except macphee the silence of the house seemed intense after their
buffeting in the wind and rain  the lights as they switched them on
successively revealed empty rooms and empty passages which wore the
abandoned look of indoor midnight—fires dead in the grates  an evening
paper on a sofa  a clock that had stopped  but no one had really
expected to find much else on the ground floor 

“now for upstairs ” said dimble 

“the lights are on upstairs ” said jane  as they all came to the foot of
the staircase 

“we turned them on ourselves from the passage ” said dimble 

“i dont think we did ” said denniston 

“excuse me ” said dimble to macphee  “i think perhaps id better go
first ”

up to the first landing they were in darkness  on the second and last
the light from the first floor fell  at each landing the stair made a
right-angled turn  so that till you reached the second you could not see
the lobby on the floor above  jane and denniston  who were last  saw
macphee and dimble stopped dead on the second landing  their faces in
profile lit up  the backs of their heads in darkness  the ulstermans
mouth was shut like a trap  his expression hostile and afraid  dimble
was open-mouthed  then  forcing her tired limbs to run  jane got up
beside them and saw what they saw 

looking down on them from the balustrade were two men  one clothed in
sweepy garments of red and the other in blue  it was the director who
wore blue  and for one instant a thought that was pure nightmare crossed
janes mind  the two robed figures looked to be two of the same sort      
and what  after all  did she know of this director who had conjured
her into his house and made her dream dreams and taught her the fear of
hell that very night  and there they were  the pair of them  talking
their secrets and doing whatever such people would do  when they had
emptied the house or laid its inhabitants to sleep  the man who had been
dug up out of the earth and the man who had been in outer space      
and the one had told them that the other was an enemy  and now  the
moment they met  here were the two of them  run together like two drops
of quicksilver  all this time she had hardly looked at the stranger  the
director seemed to have laid aside his crutch  and jane had hardly seen
him standing so straight and still before  the light so fell on his
beard that it became a kind of halo  and on top of his head also she
caught the glint of gold  suddenly  while she thought of these things 
she found that her eyes were looking straight into the eyes of the
stranger  next moment she had noticed his size  the man was monstrous 
and the two men were allies  and the stranger was speaking and pointing
at her as he spoke 

she did not understand the words  but dimble did  and heard merlin
saying in what seemed to him a rather strange kind of latin 

“sir  you have in your house the falsest lady of any at this time
alive ”

and dimble heard the director answer in the same language 

“sir  you are mistaken  she is doubtless like all of us a sinner  but
the woman is chaste ”

“sir ” said merlin  “know well that she has done in logres a thing of
which no less sorrow shall come than came of the stroke that balinus
struck  for  sir  it was the purpose of god that she and her lord should
between them have begotten a child by whom the enemies should have been
put out of logres for a thousand years ”

“she is but lately married ” said ransom  “the child may yet be born ”

“sir ” said merlin  “be assured that the child will never be born  for
the hour of its begetting is passed  of their own will they are barren 
i did not know till now that the usages of sulva were so common among
you  for a hundred generations in two lines the begetting of this child
was prepared  and unless god should rip up the work of time  such seed 
and such an hour  in such a land  shall never be again ”

“enough said ” answered ransom  “the woman perceives that we are
speaking of her ”

“it would be great charity ” said merlin  “if you gave order that her
head should be cut from her shoulders  for it is a weariness to look at
her ”

jane  though she had a smattering of latin  had not understood their
conversation  the accent was unfamiliar  and the old druid used a
vocabulary that was far beyond her reading—the latin of a man to whom
apuleius and martianus capella were the primary classics and whose
elegances resembled those of the  hisperica famina   but dimble had
followed it  he thrust jane behind him and called out 

“ransom  what in heavens name is the meaning of this ”

merlin spoke again in latin  and ransom was just turning to answer him
when dimble interrupted 

“answer  us  ” he said  “what has happened  why are you dressed up like
that  what are you doing with that bloodthirsty old man ”

macphee  who had followed the latin even less than jane  but who had
been staring at merlin as an angry terrier stares at a newfoundland dog
which has invaded its own garden  broke into the conversation 

“dr  ransom ” he said  “i dont know who the big man is and im no
latinist  but i know well that youve kept me under your eye all this
night against my own expressed will  and allowed me to be drugged and
hypnotised  it gives me little pleasure  i assure you  to see yourself
dressed up like something out of a pantomime and standing there
hand-in-glove with that yogi  or shaman  or priest  or whatever he is 
and you can tell him he need not look at me the way hes doing  im not
afraid of him  and as for my own life and limb—if you  dr  ransom  have
changed sides after all thats come and gone  i dont know that ive
much more use for either  but though i may be killed  im not going to
be made a fool of  were waiting for an explanation ”

the director looked down on them in silence for a few seconds 

“has it really come to this ” he said  “does not one of you trust me ”

“i do  sir ” said jane suddenly 

“these appeals to the passions and emotions ” said macphee  “are nothing
to the purpose  i could cry as well as anyone this moment if i gave my
mind to it ”

“well ” said the director  after a pause  “there is some excuse for you
all  for we have all been mistaken  so has the enemy  this man is
merlinus ambrosius  they thought that if he came back he would be on
their side  i find he is on ours  you  dimble  ought to realise that
this was always a possibility ”

“that is true ” said dimble  “i suppose it was—well  the look of the
thing—you and he standing there together  like  that   and his appalling
bloodthirstiness ”

“i have been startled by it myself ” said ransom  “but after all we had
no right to expect that his penal code would be that of the nineteenth
century  i find it difficult  too  to make him understand that i am not
an absolute monarch ”

“is—is he a christian ” asked dimble 

“yes ” said ransom  “as for my clothes  i have for once put on the dress
of my office to do him honour  and because i was ashamed  he mistook
macphee and me for scullions or stable-boys  in his days  you see  men
did not  except for necessity  go about in shapeless sacks of cloth  and
drab was not a favourite colour ”

at this point merlin spoke again  dimble and the director  who alone
could follow his speech  heard him say  “who are these people  if they
are your slaves  why do they do you no reverence  if they are enemies 
why do we not destroy them ”

“they are my friends ” began ransom in latin  but macphee interrupted 

“do i understand  dr  ransom ” he said  “that you are asking us to
accept this person as a member of our organisation ”

“i am afraid ” said the director  “i cannot put it that way  he  is  a
member of the organisation  and i must command you all to accept him ”

“and secondly ” continued macphee  “i must ask what enquiries have been
made into his credentials ”

“i am fully satisfied ” answered the director  “i am as sure of his good
faith as of yours ”

“but the grounds of your confidence ” persisted macphee  “are we not to
hear them ”

“it would be hard ” said the director  “to explain to you my reasons for
trusting merlinus ambrosius  but no harder than to explain to him why 
despite many appearances which might be misunderstood  i trust you ”
there was just the ghost of a smile about his mouth as he said this 
then merlin spoke to him again in latin and he replied  after that
merlin addressed dimble 

“the pendragon tells me ” he said in his unmoved voice  “that you accuse
me for a fierce and cruel man  it is a charge i never heard before  a
third part of my substance i gave to widows and poor men  i never sought
the death of any but felons and heathen saxons  as for the woman  she
may live for me  i am not master in this house  but would it be such a
great matter if her head were struck off  do not queens and ladies who
would disdain her as their tire-woman go to the fire for less  even that
gallows bird   cruciarius   beside you—i mean you  fellow  though you
speak nothing but your own barbarous tongue  you with the face like sour
milk and the voice like a saw in a hard log and the legs like a
cranes—even that cutpurse   sector zonarius    though i would have him
to the gatehouse  yet the rope should be used on his back  not his
throat ”

macphee who realised  though without understanding the words  that he
was the subject of some unfavourable comment  stood listening with that
expression of entirely suspended judgement which is commoner in northern
ireland and the scotch lowlands than in england 

“mr  director ” he said  when merlin had finished  “i would be very
greatly obliged if——”

“come ” said the director suddenly  “we have none of us slept to-night 
arthur  will you come and light a fire for our guest in the big room at
the north end of this passage  and would someone wake the women  ask
them to bring him up refreshments  a bottle of burgundy and whatever you
have cold  and then  all to bed  we need not stir early in the morning 
all is going to be very well ”


                                   iv

“were going to have difficulties with that new colleague of ours ” said
dimble  he was alone with his wife in their room at st  annes late on
the following day 

“yes ” he repeated after a pause  “what youd call a strong colleague ”

“you look very tired  cecil ” said mrs  dimble 

“well  its been rather a gruelling conference ” said he  “hes—hes a
tiring man  oh  i know weve all been fools  i mean  weve all been
imagining that because he came back in the twentieth century hed be a
twentieth-century man  time is more important than we thought  thats
all ”

“i felt that at lunch  you know ” said his wife  “it was so silly not to
have realised that he wouldnt know about forks  but what surprised me
even more  after the first shock  was how—well  how  elegant  he was
without them  i mean you could see it wasnt a case of having no manners
but of having different ones ”

“oh  the old boys a gentleman in his own way—anyone can see that  but
      well  i dont know  i suppose its all right ”

“what happened at the meeting ”

“well  you see  everything had to be explained on both sides  wed the
dickens of a job to make him understand that ransom isnt the king of
this country or trying to become king  and then we had to break it to
him that we werent the british at all  but the english—what hed call
saxons  it took him some time to get over that ”

“i see ”

“and then macphee had to choose that moment for embarking on an
interminable explanation of the relations between scotland and ireland
and england  all of which  of course  had to be translated  it was all
nonsense  too  like a good many people macphee imagines hes a celt
when  apart from his name  theres nothing celtic about him any more
than about mr  bultitude  by the way merlinus ambrosius made a prophecy
about mr  bultitude ”

“oh  what was that ”

“he said that before christmas this bear would do the best deed that any
bear had done in britain except some other bear that none of us had ever
heard of  he keeps on saying things like that  they just pop out when
were talking about something else  and in a rather different voice  as
if he couldnt help it  he doesnt seem to know any  more  than the bit
he tells you at the moment  if you see what i mean  as if something like
a camera shutter opened at the back of his mind and closed again
immediately and just one little item came through  it has rather a
disagreeable effect ”

“he and macphee didnt quarrel again  i hope ”

“not exactly  im afraid merlinus ambrosius wasnt taking macphee very
seriously  from the fact that macphee is always being obstructive and
rather rude and yet never gets sat on  i think merlinus has concluded
that he is the directors fool  he seems to have got over his dislike
for him  but i dont think macphee is going to like merlinus ”

“did you get down to actual business ” asked mrs  dimble 

“well  in a way ” said dimble  wrinkling his forehead  “we were all at
cross purposes  you see  the business about ivys husband being in
prison came up  and merlinus wanted to know why we hadnt rescued him 
he seemed to imagine us just riding off and taking the county jail by
storm  thats the sort of thing one was up against all the time ”

“cecil ” said mrs  dimble suddenly  “is he going to be any use ”

“hes going to be able to  do  things  if thats what you mean  in that
sense theres more danger of his being too much use than too little ”

“what sort of things ” asked his wife 

“the universe is so very complicated ” said dr  dimble 

“so you have said rather often before  dear ” replied mrs  dimble 

“have i ” he said with a smile  “how often  i wonder  as often as youve
told the story of the pony and trap at dawlish ”

“cecil  i havent told it for years ”

“my dear  i heard you telling it to camilla the night before last ”

“oh   camilla   that was quite different  shed never heard it before ”

“i dont know that we can be certain even about that       the universe
being so complicated and all ”

for a few minutes there was silence between them 

“but about merlin ” asked mrs  dimble presently 

“have you ever noticed ” said dimble  “that the universe  and every
little bit of the universe  is always hardening and narrowing and coming
to a point ”

his wife waited as those wait who know by long experience the mental
processes of the person who is talking to them 

“i mean this ” said dimble  in answer to the question she had not asked 
“if you dip into any college  or school  or parish  or family—anything
you like—at a given point in its history  you always find that there was
a time before that point when there was more elbow-room and contrasts
werent quite so sharp  and that theres going to be a time after that
point when there is even less room for indecision and choices are even
more momentous  good is always getting better and bad is always getting
worse  the possibilities of even apparent neutrality are always
diminishing  the whole thing is sorting itself out all the time  coming
to a point  getting sharper and harder  like in the poem about heaven
and hell eating into merry middle earth from opposite sides       how
does it go  something about eat every day       till all is
 somethinged  away  it cant be  eaten   that wouldnt scan  my memory
has failed dreadfully these last few years  do you know the bit 
margery ”

“what you were saying reminded me more of the bit in the bible about the
winnowing fan  separating the wheat and the chaff  or like brownings
line  lifes business being just the terrible choice ”

“exactly  perhaps the whole time-process means just that and nothing
else  but its not only in questions of moral choice  everything is
getting more itself and more different from everything else all the
time  evolution means species getting less and less like one another 
minds get more and more spiritual  matter more and more material  even
in literature  poetry and prose draw further and further apart ”

mrs  dimble with the ease born of long practice averted the danger  ever
present in her house  of a merely literary turn being given to the
conversation 

“yes ” she said  “spirit and matter  certainly  that explains why people
like the studdocks find it so difficult to be happily married ”

“the studdocks ” said dimble  looking at her rather vaguely  the
domestic problems of that young couple had occupied his mind a good deal
less than they had occupied his wifes  “oh  i see  yes  i dare say that
has something to do with it  but about merlin  what it comes to  as far
as i can make out  is this  there were still possibilities for a man of
that age which there arent for a man of ours  the earth itself was more
like an animal in those days  and mental processes were much more like
physical actions  and there were—well  neutrals  knocking about ”

“neutrals ”

“i dont mean  of course  that anything can be a  real  neutral  a
conscious being is either obeying god or disobeying him  but there might
be things neutral in relation to us ”

“you mean eldils—angels ”

“well  the word  angel  rather begs the question  even the oyéresu
arent exactly angels in the same sense as our guardian angels are 
technically  they are intelligences  the point is that while it may be
true at the end of the world to describe every eldil either as an angel
or a devil  and may even be true now  it was much less true in merlins
time  there used to be things on this earth pursuing their own business 
so to speak  they werent ministering spirits sent to help fallen
humanity  but neither were they enemies preying upon us  even in st 
paul one gets glimpses of a population that wont exactly fit into our
two columns of angels and devils  and if you go back further       all
the gods  elves  dwarfs  water-people   fate  longaevi   you and i know
too much to think they are just illusions ”

“you think there are things like that ”

“i think there were  i think there was room for them then  but the
universe has come more to a point  not all rational things perhaps  some
would be mere wills inherent in matter  hardly conscious  more like
animals  others—but i dont really know  at any rate  that is the sort
of situation in which one got a man like merlin ”

“it all sounds rather horrible to me ”

“it was  rather  horrible  i mean even in merlins time  he came at the
extreme tail end of it   though you could still use that sort of life in
the universe innocently  you couldnt do it safely  the things werent
bad in themselves  but they were already bad for us  they sort of
withered the man who dealt with them  not on purpose  they couldnt help
doing it  merlinus is withered  hes quite pious and humble and all
that  but something has been taken out of him  that quietness of his is
just a little deadly  like the quiet of a gutted building  its the
result of having laid his mind open to something that broadens the
environment just a bit too much  like polygamy  it wasnt wrong for
abraham  but one cant help feeling that even he lost something by it ”

“cecil ” said mrs  dimble  “do you feel quite comfortable about the
directors using a man like this  i mean  doesnt it look a  little  bit
like fighting belbury with its own weapons ”

“no  i  had  thought of that  merlin is the reverse of belbury  hes at
the opposite extreme  he is the last vestige of an old order in which
matter and spirit were  from our modern point of view  confused  for him
every operation on nature is a kind of personal contact  like coaxing a
child or stroking ones horse  after him came the modern man to whom
nature is something dead—a machine to be worked  and taken to bits if it
wont work the way he pleases  finally come the belbury people  who take
over that view from the modern man unaltered and simply want to increase
their power by tacking on to it the aid of spirits—extra-natural 
anti-natural spirits  of course they hoped to have it both ways  they
thought the old  magia  of merlin  which worked in with the spiritual
qualities of nature  loving and reverencing them and knowing them from
within  could be combined with the new  goeteia —the brutal surgery from
without  no  in a sense  merlin represents what weve got to get back to
in some different way  do you know that he is forbidden by the rules of
his order ever to use any edged tool on any growing thing ”

“good gracious ” said mrs  dimble  “theres six oclock  id promised
ivy to be in the kitchen at quarter to  theres no need for  you  to
move  cecil ”

“do you know ” said dimble  “i think you are a wonderful woman ”

“why ”

“how many women who had had their own house for thirty years would be
able to fit into this menagerie as you do ”

“thats nothing ” said mrs  dimble  “ivy had her own house too  you
know  and its much worse for her  after all  i havent got my husband
in jail ”

“you jolly soon will have ” said dimble  “if half the plans of merlinus
ambrosius are put into action ”


                                   v

merlin and the director were meanwhile talking in the blue room  the
director had put aside his robe and circlet and lay on his sofa  the
druid sat in a chair facing him  his legs uncrossed  his pale large
hands motionless on his knees  looking to modern eyes like an old
conventional carving of a king  he was still robed and beneath the robe 
as ransom knew  had surprisingly little clothing  for the warmth of the
house was to him excessive and he found trousers uncomfortable  his loud
demands for oil after his bath had involved some hurried shopping in the
village which had finally produced  by dennistons exertions  a tin of
brilliantine  merlinus had used it freely so that his hair and beard
glistened and the sweet sticky smell filled the room  that was why mr 
bultitude had pawed so insistently at the door that he was finally
admitted and now sat as near the magician as he could possibly get  his
nostrils twitching  he had never smelled such an interesting man before 

“sir ” said merlin  in answer to the question which the director had
just asked him  “i give you great thanks  i cannot  indeed  understand
the way you live  and your house is strange to me  you give me a bath
such as the emperor himself might envy  but no one attends me to it  a
bed softer than sleep itself  but when i rise from it i find i must put
on my own clothes with my own hands as if i were a peasant  i lie in a
room with windows of pure crystal so that you can see the sky as clearly
when they are shut as when they are open  and there is not wind enough
within the room to blow out an unguarded taper  but i lie in it alone 
with no more honour than a prisoner in a dungeon  your people eat dry
and tasteless flesh  but it is off plates as smooth as ivory and as
round as the sun  in all the house there is warmth and softness and
silence that might put a man in mind of paradise terrestrial  but no
hangings  no beautified pavements  no musicians  no perfumes  no high
seats  not a gleam of gold  not a hawk  not a hound  you seem to me to
live neither like a rich man nor a poor one  neither like a lord nor a
hermit  sir  i tell you these things because you have asked me  they are
of no importance  now that none hears us save the last of the seven
bears of logres  it is time that we should open counsels to each other ”

he glanced at the directors face as he spoke and then  as if startled
by what he saw there  leaned sharply forward 

“does your wound pain you ” he asked 

ransom shook his head  “no ” he said  “it is not the wound  we have
terrible things to talk of ”

“sir ” said merlinus in a deeper and softer voice  “i could take all the
anguish from your heel as though i were wiping it out with a sponge 
give me but seven days to go in and out and up and down and to and fro 
to renew old acquaintance  these fields and i  this wood and i  have
much to say to one another ”

as he said this he was leaning forward so that his face and the bears
were almost side by side  and it almost looked as if those two might
have been engaged in some kind of furry and grunted conversation  the
druids face had a strangely animal appearance  not sensual nor fierce 
but full of the patient  unarguing sagacity of a beast  ransoms 
meanwhile  was full of torment 

“you might find the country much changed ” he said  forcing a smile 

“no ” said merlin  “i do not reckon to find it much changed ” the
distance between the two men was increasing every moment  merlin was
like something that ought not to be indoors  bathed and anointed though
he was  a sense of mould  gravel  wet leaves  weedy water  hung about
him 

“not  changed  ” he repeated in an almost inaudible voice  and in that
deepening inner silence of which his face bore witness  one might have
believed that he listened continually to a murmur of evasive sounds 
rustling of mice and stoats  thumping progression of frogs  the small
shock of falling hazel nuts  creaking of branches  runnels trickling 
the very growing of grass  the bear had closed its eyes  the whole room
was growing heavy with a sort of floating anaesthesia 

“through me ” said merlin  “you can suck up from the earth oblivion of
all pains ”

“silence ” said the director sharply  he had been sinking down into the
cushions of his sofa with his head drooping a little towards his chest 
now he suddenly sat bolt upright  the magician started and straightened
himself likewise  the air of the room was cleared  even the bear opened
its eyes again 

“no ” said the director  “gods glory  do you think you were dug out of
the earth to give me a plaster for my heel  we have drugs that could
cheat the pain as well as your earth-magic or better  if it were not my
business to bear it to the end  i will hear no more of that  do you
understand ”

“i hear and obey ” said the magician  “but i meant no harm  if not to
heal your own wound  yet for the healing of logres  you will need my
commerce with field and water  it must be that i should go in and out 
and to and fro  renewing old acquaintance  it will not be changed  you
know—not what you would call  changed  ”

again that sweet heaviness  like the smell of hawthorn  seemed to be
flowing back over the blue room 

“no ” said the director in a still louder voice  “that cannot be done
any longer  the soul has gone out of the wood and water  oh  i dare say
you could awake them—a little  but it would not be enough  a storm  or
even a river-flood  would be of little avail against our present enemy 
your weapon would break in your hands  for the hideous strength
confronts us  and it is as in the days when nimrod built a tower to
reach heaven ”

“hidden it may be ” said merlinus  “but not  changed   leave me to work 
lord  i will wake it  i will set a sword in every blade of grass to
wound them and the very clods of earth shall be venom to their feet  i
will——”

“no ” said the director  “i forbid you to speak of it  if it were
possible  it would be unlawful  whatever of spirit may still linger in
the earth has withdrawn fifteen hundred years further away from us since
your time  you shall not speak a word to it  you shall not lift your
little finger to call it up  i command you  it is in this age utterly
unlawful ” hitherto he had been speaking sternly and coldly  now he
leaned forward and said in a different voice  “it never was  very 
lawful  even in your day  remember  when we first knew that you would be
awaked  we thought you would be on the side of the enemy  and because
our lord does all things for each  one of the purposes of your
reawakening was that your own soul should be saved ”

merlin sank back into his chair like a man unstrung  the bear licked his
hand where it hung  pale and relaxed  over the arm of the chair 

“sir ” said merlin presently  “if i am not to work for you in that
fashion  then you have taken into your house a silly bulk of flesh  for
i am no longer much of a man of war  if it comes to point and edge  i
avail little ”

“not that way either ” said ransom  hesitating like a man who is
reluctant to come to the point  “no power that is merely earthly ” he
continued at last  “will serve against the hideous strength ”

“then let us all to prayers ” said merlinus  “but there also       i was
not reckoned of much account       they called me a devils son  some of
them  it was a lie  but i do not know why i have been brought back ”

“certainly  let us stick to our prayers ” said ransom  “now and always 
but that was not what i meant  there are celestial powers  created
powers  not in this earth  but in the heavens ”

merlinus looked at him in silence 

“you know well what i am speaking of ” said ransom  “did not i tell you
when we first met that the oyéresu were my masters ”

“of course ” said merlin  “and that was how i knew you were of the
college  is it not our password all over the earth ”

“a password ” exclaimed ransom  with a look of surprise  “i did not know
that ”

“but       but ” said merlinus  “if you knew not the password  how did
you come to say it ”

“i said it because it was true ”

the magician licked his lips which had become very pale 

“true as the plainest things are true ” repeated ransom  “true as it is
true that you sit here with my bear beside you ”

merlin spread out his hands  “you are my father and mother ” he said 
his eyes  steadily fixed on ransom  were large as those of an awe-struck
child  but for the rest he looked a smaller man than ransom had first
taken him to be 

“suffer me to speak ” he said at last  “or slay me if you will  for i am
in the hollow of your hand  i had heard of it in my own days—that some
had spoken with the gods  blaise  my master  knew a few words of that
speech  yet these were  after all  powers of earth  for—i need not teach
you  you know more than i—it is not the very oyéresu  the true powers of
heaven  whom the greatest of our craft meet  but only their earthly
wraiths  their shadows  only the earth-venus  the earth-mercurius  not
perelandra herself  not viritrilbia himself  it is only——”

“i am not speaking of the wraiths ” said ransom  “i have stood before
mars himself in the sphere of mars and before venus herself in the
sphere of venus  it is their strength  and the strength of some greater
than they  which will destroy our enemies ”

“but  lord ” said merlin  “how can this be  is it not against the
seventh law ”

“what law is that ” asked ransom 

“has not our fair lord made it a law for himself that he will not send
down the powers to mend or mar in this earth until the end of all
things  or is this the end that is even now coming to pass ”

“it may be the beginning of the end ” said ransom  “but i know nothing
of that  maleldil may have made it a law not to send down the powers 
but if men by enginry and natural philosophy learn to fly into the
heavens  and come  in the flesh  among the heavenly powers and trouble
them  he has not forbidden the powers to react  for all this is within
the natural order  a wicked man did learn so to do  he came flying  by a
subtle engine  to where mars dwells in heaven and to where venus dwells 
and took me with him as a captive  and there i spoke with the true
oyéresu face to face  you understand me ”

merlin inclined his head 

“and so the wicked man had brought about  even as judas brought about 
the thing he least intended  for now there was one man in the world—even
myself—who was known to the oyéresu and spoke their tongue  neither by
gods miracle nor by magic from numinor  but naturally  as when two men
meet in a road  our enemies had taken away from themselves the
protection of the seventh law  they had broken by natural philosophy the
barrier which god of his own power would not break  even so they sought
you as a friend and raised up for themselves a scourge  and that is why
powers of heaven have come down to this house  and in this chamber where
we are now discoursing  malacandra and perelandra have spoken to me ”

merlins face became a little paler  the bear nosed at his hand 
unnoticed 

“i have become a bridge ” said ransom 

“sir ” said merlin “what will come of this  if they put forth their
power  they will unmake all middle earth ”

“their naked power  yes ” said ransom  “that is why they will work only
through a man ”

the magician drew one large hand across his forehead 

“through a man whose mind is opened to be so invaded ” said ransom  “one
who by his own will once opened it  i take our fair lord to witness that
if it were my task i would not refuse it  but he will not suffer a mind
that still has its virginity to be so violated  and through a black
magicians mind their purity neither can nor will operate  one who has
dabbled       in the days when dabbling had not begun to be evil  or was
only just beginning       and also a christian man and a penitent  a
tool  i must speak plainly  good enough to be so used and not too good 
in all these western parts of the world there was only one man who had
lived in those days and could still be recalled  you      ”

he stopped  shocked at what was happening  the huge man had risen from
his chair  and stood towering over him  from his horribly opened mouth
there came a yell that seemed to ransom utterly bestial  though it was
in fact only the yell of primitive celtic lamentation  it was horrifying
to see that withered and bearded face all blubbered with undisguised
tears like a childs  all the roman surface in merlinus had been scraped
off  he had become a shameless  archaic monstrosity  babbling out
entreaties in a mixture of what sounded like welsh and what sounded like
spanish 

“silence ” shouted ransom  “sit down  you put us both to shame ”

as suddenly as it had begun the frenzy ended  merlin resumed his chair 
to a modern it seemed strange that  having recovered his self-control 
he did not show the slightest embarrassment at his temporary loss of it 
the whole character of the two-sided society in which this man must have
lived became clearer to ransom than pages of history could have made it 

“do not think ” said ransom  “that for me either it is childs play to
meet those who will come down for your empowering ”

“sir ” faltered merlin  “you have been in heaven  i am but a man  i am
not the son of one of the airish men  that was a lying story  how can i 
      you are not as i  you have looked upon their faces before ”

“not on all of them ” said ransom  “greater spirits than malacandra and
perelandra will descend this time  we are in gods hands  it may unmake
us both  there is no promise that either you or i will save our lives or
our reason  i do not know how we can dare to look upon their faces  but
i know we cannot dare to look upon gods if we refuse this enterprise ”

suddenly the magician smote his hand upon his knee 

“ mehercule  ” he cried  “are we not going too fast  if you are the
pendragon  i am the high council of logres  and i will council you  if
the powers must tear me in pieces to break our enemies  gods will be
done  but is it yet come to that  this saxon king of yours who sits at
windsor  now—is there no help in him ”

“he has no power in this matter ”

“then is he not weak enough to be overthrown ”

“i have no wish to overthrow him  he is the king  he was crowned and
anointed by the archbishop  in the order of logres i may be pendragon 
but in the order of britain i am the kings man ”

“is it  then  his great men—the counts and legates and bishops—who do
the evil and he does not know of it ”

“it is—though they are not exactly the sort of great men you have in
mind ”

“and are we not big enough to meet them in plain battle ”

“we are four men  some women  and a bear ”

“i saw the time when logres was only myself and one man and two boys 
and one of those was a churl  yet we conquered ”

“it could not be done now  they have an engine called the press whereby
the people are deceived  we should die without even being heard of ”

“but what of the true clerks  is there no help in them  it cannot be
that  all  your priests and bishops are corrupted ”

“the faith itself is torn in pieces since your day and speaks with a
divided voice  even if it were made whole  the christians are but a
tenth part of the people  there is no help there ”

“then let us seek help from over sea  is there no christian prince in
neustria or ireland or benwick who would come in and cleanse britain if
he were called ”

“there is no christian prince left  these other countries are even as
britain  or else sunk deeper still in the disease ”

“then we must go higher  we must go to him whose office it is to put
down tyrants and give life to dying kingdoms  we must call on the
emperor ”

“there is no emperor ”

“no emperor      ” began merlin  and then his voice died away  he sat
still for some minutes wrestling with a world which he had never
envisaged  presently he said  “a thought comes into my mind and i do not
know whether it is good or evil  but because i am the high council of
logres i will not hide it from you  this is a cold age in which i have
awaked  if all this west part of the world is apostate  might it not be
lawful  in our great need  to look further       beyond christendom 
should we not find some even among the heathen who are not wholly
corrupt  there were tales in my day of some such  men who knew not the
articles of our most holy faith but who worshipped god as they could and
acknowledged the law of nature  sir  i believe it would be lawful to
seek help even there—beyond byzantium  it was rumoured also that there
was knowledge in those lands—an eastern circle and wisdom that came west
from numinor  i know not where—babylon  arabia  or cathay  you said your
ships had sailed all round the earth  above and beneath ”

ransom shook his head  “you do not understand ” he said  “the poison was
brewed in these west lands but it has spat itself everywhere by now 
however far you went you would find the machines  the crowded cities 
the empty thrones  the false writings  the barren beds  men maddened
with false promises and soured with true miseries  worshipping the iron
works of their own hands  cut off from earth their mother and from the
father in heaven  you might go east so far that east became west and you
returned to britain across the great ocean  but even so you would not
have come out anywhere into the light  the shadow of one dark wing is
over all tellus ”

“is it  then  the end ” asked merlin 

“and this ” said ransom  ignoring the question  “is why we have no way
left at all save the one i have told you  the hideous strength holds all
this earth in its fist to squeeze as it wishes  but for their one
mistake  there would be no hope left  if of their own evil will they had
not broken the frontier and let in the celestial powers  this would be
their moment of victory  their own strength has betrayed them  they have
gone to the gods who would not have come to them  and pulled down deep
heaven on their heads  therefore they will die  for though you search
every cranny to escape  now that you see all crannies closed  you will
not disobey me ”

and then  very slowly  there crept back into merlins white face  first
closing his dismayed mouth and finally gleaming in his eyes  that almost
animal expression  earthy and healthy and with a glint of half-humorous
cunning 

“well ” he said  “if the earths are stopped the fox faces the hounds 
but had i known who you were at our first meeting i think i would have
put the sleep on you as i did on your fool ”

“i am a very light sleeper since i have travelled in the heavens ” said
ransom 




                                fourteen
                        “ real life is meeting ”


                                   i

since the day and night of the outer world made no difference in marks
cell  he did not know whether it was minutes or hours later that he
found himself once more awake  once more confronting frost  and still
fasting  the professor came to ask if he had thought over their recent
conversation  mark  who judged that some decent show of reluctance would
make his final surrender more convincing replied that only one thing was
still troubling him  he did not quite understand what he in particular
or humanity in general stood to gain by co-operation with the macrobes 
he saw clearly that the motives on which most men act  and which they
dignify by the names of patriotism or duty to humanity  were mere
products of the animal organism  varying according to the behaviour
pattern of different communities  but he did not yet see what was to be
substituted for these irrational motives  on what ground henceforward
were actions to be justified or condemned 

“if one insists on putting the question in those terms ” said frost  “i
think waddington has given the best answer  existence is its own
justification  the tendency to developmental change which we call
evolution is justified by the fact that it is a general characteristic
of biological entities  the present establishment of contact between the
highest biological entities and the macrobes is justified by the fact
that it is occurring  and it ought to be increased because an increase
is taking place ”

“you think  then ” said mark  “that there would be no sense in asking
whether the general tendency of the universe might be in the direction
we should call bad ”

“there could be no sense at all ” said frost  “the judgement you are
trying to make turns out on inspection to be simply an expression of
emotion  huxley himself could only express it by using nakedly emotive
terms such as gladiatorial or ruthless  i am referring to the famous
 romanes  lecture  when the so-called struggle for existence is seen
simply as an actuarial theorem we have  in waddingtons words  a
concept as unemotional as a definite integral and the emotion
disappears  with it disappears that preposterous idea of an external
standard of value which the emotion produced ”

“and the actual tendency of events ” said mark  “would still be
self-justified and in that sense good when it was working for the
extinction of all organic life  as it presently will ”

“of course ” replied frost  “if you insist on formulating the problem in
those terms  in reality the question is meaningless  it presupposes a
means-and-end pattern of thought which descends from aristotle who in
his turn was merely hypostatising elements in the experience of an
iron-age  agricultural community  motives are not the causes of action
but its by-products  you are merely wasting your time by considering
them  when you have attained real objectivity you will recognise not
 some  motives but  all  motives as merely animal  subjective
epiphenomena  you will then have no motives and you will find that you
do not need them  their place will be supplied by something else which
you will presently understand better than you do now  so far from being
impoverished your action will become much more efficient ”

“i see ” said mark  the philosophy which frost was expounding was by no
means unfamiliar to him  he recognised it at once as the logical
conclusion of thoughts which he had always hitherto accepted and which
at this moment he found himself irrevocably rejecting  the knowledge
that his own assumptions led to frosts position combined with what he
saw in frosts face and what he had experienced in this very cell 
effected a complete conversion  all the philosophers and evangelists in
the world might not have done the job so neatly 

“and that ” continued frost  “is why a systematic training in
objectivity must be given to you  its purpose is to eliminate from your
mind one by one the things you have hitherto regarded as grounds for
action  it is like killing a nerve  that whole system of instinctive
preferences  whatever ethical  aesthetic  or logical disguise they wear 
is to be simply destroyed ”

“i get the idea ” said mark  though with an inward reservation that his
present instinctive desire to batter the professors face into a jelly
would take a good deal of destroying 

after that frost took mark from the cell and gave him a meal in some
neighbouring room  it also was lit by artificial light and had no
window  the professor stood perfectly still and watched him while he
ate  mark did not know what the food was and did not much like it  but
he was far too hungry by now to refuse it if refusal had been possible 
when the meal was over frost led him to the ante-room of the head and
once more he was stripped and re-clothed in surgeons overalls and a
mask  then he was brought in  into the presence of the gaping and
dribbling head  to his surprise frost took not the slightest notice of
it  he led him across the room to a narrower little door with a pointed
arch  in the far wall  here he paused and said  “go in  you will speak
to no one of what you find here  i will return presently ” then he
opened the door and mark went in 

the room  at first sight  was an anticlimax  it appeared to be an empty
committee room with a long table  eight or nine chairs  some pictures 
and  oddly enough  a large step-ladder in one corner  here also there
were no windows  it was lit by an electric light which produced  better
than mark had ever seen it produced before  the illusion of daylight—of
a cold  grey place out of doors  this  combined with the absence of a
fireplace  made it seem chilly though the temperature was not in fact
very low 

a man of trained sensibility would have seen at once that the room was
ill proportioned  not grotesquely so but sufficiently to produce
dislike  it was too high and too narrow  mark felt the effect without
analysing the cause and the effect grew on him as time passed  sitting
staring about him he next noticed the door—and thought at first that he
was the victim of some optical illusion  it took him quite a long time
to prove to himself that he was not  the point of the arch was not in
the centre  the whole thing was lop-sided  once again  the error was not
gross  the thing was near enough to the true to deceive you for a moment
and to go on teasing the mind even after the deception had been
unmasked  involuntarily one kept on shifting the head to find positions
from which it would look right after all  he turned round and sat with
his back to it       one mustnt let it become an obsession 

then he noticed the spots on the ceiling  they were not mere specks of
dirt or discoloration  they were deliberately painted on  little round
black spots placed at irregular intervals on the pale mustard-coloured
surface  there were not a great many of them  perhaps thirty       or
was it a hundred  he determined that he would not fall into the trap of
trying to count them  they would be hard to count  they were so
irregularly placed  or werent they  now that his eyes were growing used
to them  and one couldnt help noticing that there were five in that
little group to the right   their arrangement seemed to hover on the
verge of regularity  they suggested some kind of pattern  their peculiar
ugliness consisted in the very fact that they kept on suggesting it and
then frustrating the expectation thus aroused  suddenly he realised that
this was another trap  he fixed his eyes on the table 

there were spots on the table  too—white ones  shiny white spots  not
quite round  and arranged  apparently  to correspond to the spots on the
ceiling  or were they  no  of course not       ah  now he had it  the
pattern  if you could call it a pattern  on the table was an exact
reversal of that on the ceiling  but with certain exceptions  he found
he was glancing rapidly from the one to the other  trying to puzzle it
out  for the third time he checked himself  he got up and began to walk
about  he had a look at the pictures 

some of them belonged to a school of art with which he was already
familiar  there was a portrait of a young woman who held her mouth wide
open to reveal the fact that the inside of it was thickly overgrown with
hair  it was very skilfully painted in the photographic manner so that
you could almost feel that hair  indeed you could not avoid feeling it
however hard you tried  there was a giant mantis playing a fiddle while
being eaten by another mantis  and a man with corkscrews instead of arms
bathing in a flat  sadly coloured sea beneath a summer sunset  but most
of the pictures were not of this kind  at first sight most of them
seemed rather ordinary  though mark was a little surprised at the
predominance of scriptural themes  it was only at the second or third
glance that one discovered certain unaccountable details—something odd
about the positions of the figures feet or the arrangement of their
fingers or the grouping  and who was the person standing between the
christ and the lazarus  and why were there so many beetles under the
table in the last supper  what was the curious trick of lighting that
made each picture look like something seen in delirium  when once these
questions had been raised the apparent ordinariness of the pictures
became their supreme menace—like the ominous surface innocence at the
beginning of certain dreams  every fold of drapery  every piece of
architecture  had a meaning one could not grasp but which withered the
mind  compared with these the other  surrealistic  pictures were mere
foolery  long ago mark had read somewhere of “things of that extreme
evil which seems innocent to the uninitiate ” and had wondered what sort
of things they might be  now he felt he knew 

he turned his back on the pictures and sat down  he understood the whole
business now  frost was not trying to make him insane  at least not in
the sense mark had hitherto given to the word “insanity ” frost had
meant what he said  to sit in the room was the first step towards what
frost called objectivity—the process whereby all specifically human
reactions were killed in a man so that he might become fit for the
fastidious society of the macrobes  higher degrees in the asceticism of
anti-nature would doubtless follow  the eating of abominable food  the
dabbling in dirt and blood  the ritual performances of calculated
obscenities  they were  in a sense  playing quite fair with him—offering
him the very same initiation through which they themselves had passed
and which had divided them from humanity  distending and dissipating
wither into a shapeless ruin while it condensed and sharpened frost into
the hard  bright  little needle that he now was 

but after an hour or so this long  high coffin of a room began to
produce on mark an effect which his instructor had probably not
anticipated  there was no return of the attack which he had suffered
last night in the cell  whether because he had already survived that
attack  or because the imminence of death had drawn the tooth of his
lifelong desire for the esoteric  or because he had  in a fashion 
called very urgently for help  the built and painted perversity of this
room had the effect of making him aware  as he had never been aware
before  of this rooms opposite  as the desert first teaches men to love
water  or as absence first reveals affection  there rose up against this
background of the sour and the crooked some kind of vision of the sweet
and the straight  something else—something he vaguely called the
“normal”—apparently existed  he had never thought about it before  but
there it was—solid  massive  with a shape of its own  almost like
something you could touch  or eat  or fall in love with  it was all
mixed up with jane and fried eggs and soap and sunlight and the rooks
cawing at cure hardy and the thought that  somewhere outside  daylight
was going on at that moment  he was not thinking in moral terms at all 
or else  what is much the same thing  he was having his first deeply
moral experience  he was choosing a side  the normal  “all that ” as he
called it  was what he chose  if the scientific point of view led away
from “all that ” then be damned to the scientific point of view  the
vehemence of his choice almost took his breath away  he had not had such
a sensation before  for the moment he hardly cared if frost and wither
killed him 

i do not know how long this mood would have lasted  but while it was
still at its height frost returned  he led mark to a bedroom where a
fire blazed and an old man lay in bed  the light gleaming on glasses and
silver and the soft luxury of the room so raised marks spirits that he
found it difficult to listen while frost told him that he must remain
here on duty till relieved and must ring up the deputy director if the
patient spoke or stirred  he himself was to say nothing  indeed it would
be useless if he did  for the patient did not understand english 

frost retired  mark glanced round the room  he was reckless now  he saw
no possibility of leaving belbury alive unless he allowed himself to be
made into a dehumanised servant of the macrobes  meanwhile  do or die
for it  he was going to have a meal  there were all sorts of delights on
that table  perhaps a smoke first  with his feet on the fender 

“damn ” he said as he put his hand into his pocket and found it empty 
at the same moment he noticed that the man in the bed had opened his
eyes and was looking at him  “im sorry ” said mark  “i didnt mean——”
and then stopped 

the man sat up in bed and jerked his head towards the door 

“ah ” he said enquiringly 

“i beg your pardon ” said mark 

“ah ” said the man again  and then  “foreigners  eh ”

“you  do  speak english  then ” said mark 

“ah ” said the man  after a pause of several seconds he said  “guvner ”
mark looked at him  “guvner ” repeated the patient with great energy 
“you hant got such a thing as a bit of baccy about you  ah ”


                                   ii

“i think thats all we can do for the present ” said mother dimble 
“well do the flowers this afternoon ” she was speaking to jane and both
were in what was called the lodge—a little stone house beside the garden
door at which jane had been first admitted to the manor  mrs  dimble and
jane had been preparing it for the maggs family  for mr  maggss
sentence expired to-day and ivy had gone off by train on the previous
afternoon to spend the night with an aunt in the town where he was
imprisoned and to meet him at the prison gates 

when mrs  dimble had told her husband how she would be engaged that
morning  he had said  “well  it cant take you very long just lighting a
fire and making a bed ” i share dr  dimbles sex and his limitation  i
have no idea what the two women found to do in the lodge for all the
hours they spent there  even jane had hardly anticipated it  in mrs 
dimbles hands the task of airing the little house and making the bed
for ivy maggs and her jail-bird husband became something between a game
and a ritual  it woke in jane vague memories of helping at christmas or
easter decorations in church when she had been a small child  but it
also suggested to her literary memory all sorts of things out of
sixteenth-century epithalamions—age-old superstitions  jokes  and
sentimentalities about bridal beds and marriage bowers  with omens at
the threshold and fairies upon the hearth  it was an atmosphere
extraordinarily alien to that in which she had grown up  a few weeks ago
she would have disliked it  was there not something absurd about that
stiff  twinkling archaic world—the mixture of prudery and sensuality 
the stylised ardours of the groom and the conventional bashfulness of
the bride  the religious sanction  the permitted salacities of
fescennine song  and the suggestion that everyone except the principals
might be expected to be rather tipsy  how had the human race ever come
to imprison in such a ceremony the most unceremonious thing in the
world  but she was no longer sure of her reaction  what she was sure of
was the dividing line that included mother dimble in that world and left
her outside  mother dimble  for all her nineteenth-century propriety  or
perhaps because of it  struck her this afternoon as being herself an
archaic person  at every moment she seemed to join hands with some
solemn yet roguish company of busy old women who had been tucking young
lovers into beds since the world began with an incongruous mixture of
nods and winks and blessings and tears—quite impossible old women in
ruffs or wimples who would be making shakespearean jokes about codpieces
and cuckoldry at one moment and kneeling devoutly at altars the next  it
was very odd  for  of course  as far as their conversation was concerned
the difference between them was reversed  jane  in a literary argument 
could have talked about codpieces with great sang-froid  while mother
dimble was an edwardian lady who would simply have ignored such a
subject out of existence if any modernised booby had been so unfortunate
as to raise it in her presence  perhaps the weather had some bearing on
janes curious sensations  the frost had ended and it was one of those
days of almost piercingly sweet mildness which sometimes occur in the
beginning of winter 

ivy had discussed her own story with jane only the day before  mr  maggs
had stolen some money from the laundry that he worked for  he had done
this before he met ivy and at a time when he had got into bad company 
since he and ivy had started going out together he had gone “as straight
as straight”  but the little crime had been unearthed and come out of
the past to catch him  and he had been arrested about six weeks after
their marriage  jane had said very little during the telling of this
story  ivy had not seemed conscious of the purely social stigma
attaching to petty theft and a term of imprisonment  so that jane would
have had no opportunity to practise  even if she had wished  that almost
technical “kindness” which some people reserve for the sorrows of the
poor  on the other hand she was given no chance to be revolutionary or
speculative—to suggest that theft was no more criminal than all wealth
was criminal  ivy seemed to take traditional morality for granted  she
had been “ever so upset” about it  it seemed to matter a great deal in
one way  and not to matter at all in another  it had never occurred to
her that it should alter her relations with her husband—as though theft 
like ill health  were one of the normal risks one took in getting
married 

“i always say  you cant expect to know everything about a boy till
youre married  not really ” she had said 

“i suppose not ” said jane 

“of course its the same for them ” added ivy  “my old dad used often to
say hed never have married mum not if hed known how she snored  and
she said herself  no  dad  that you wouldnt ”

“thats rather different  i suppose ” said jane 

“well  what i say is  if it wasnt that itd be something else  thats
how i look at it  and it isnt as if they hadnt a lot to put up with 
too  because theyve sort of got to get married if theyre the right
sort  poor things  but  whatever we say  jane  a woman takes a lot of
living with  i dont mean what youd call a bad woman  i remember one
day—it was before you came—mother dimble was saying something to the
doctor  and there he was sitting reading something—you know the way he
does—with his fingers under some of the pages and a pencil in his
hand—not the way you or id read—and he just said yes  dear  and we
both of us knew he hadnt been listening  and i said  there you are 
mother dimble  said i  thats how they treat us once theyre married 
they dont even listen to what we say  i said  and do you know what she
said  ivy maggs  said she  did it ever come into your mind to ask
whether anyone  could  listen to all we say  those were her very words 
of course i wasnt going to give in to it  not before him  so i said 
yes  they could  but it was a fair knock-out  you know often ive been
talking to my husband for a long time and hes looked up and asked me
what ive been saying and  do you know  i havent been able to remember
myself ”

“oh  thats different ” said jane  “its when people drift apart—take up
quite different opinions—join different sides       ”

“you must be ever so anxious about mr  studdock ” replied ivy  “id
never be able to sleep a wink if i were in your shoes  but the
directorll bring it all right in the end  you see if he dont ”

mrs  dimble went back to the house presently to fetch some little nicety
which would put the finishing touch to the bedroom in the lodge  jane 
feeling a little tired  knelt on the window-seat and put her elbows on
the sill and her chin in her hands  the sun was almost hot  the thought
of going back to mark if mark were ever rescued from belbury was one
which her mind had long accepted  it was not horrifying to her  but flat
and insipid  it was not the less so because at this moment she fully
forgave him for his conjugal crime of sometimes apparently preferring
her person to her conversation and sometimes his own thoughts to both 
why should anyone be particularly interested in what she said  this new
humility would even have been pleasant to her if it had been directed to
anyone more exciting than mark  she must  of course  be very different
with him when they met again  but it was that “again” which so took the
savour out of the good resolution—like going back to a sum one had
already got wrong and working it out afresh on the same scrawled page of
the exercise book  “if they met again      ” she felt guilty at her lack
of anxiety  almost at the same moment she found that she was a little
anxious  for hitherto she had always somehow assumed that mark would
come back  the possibility of his death now presented itself  she had no
direct emotions about herself living afterwards  she just saw the image
of mark dead  that face dead  in the middle of a pillow  that whole body
rigid  those hands and arms  for good and ill so different from all
other hands and arms  stretched out straight and useless like a dolls 
she felt very cold  yet the sun was hotter than ever—almost impossibly
hot for the time of year  it was very still  too  so still that she
could hear the movements of a small bird which was hopping along the
path outside the window  this path led to the door in the garden wall by
which she had first entered  the bird hopped on to the threshold of that
door  and on to someones foot  for now jane saw that someone was
sitting on a little seat just inside the door  this person was only a
few yards away  and she must have been sitting very quiet for jane not
to have noticed her 

a flame-coloured robe  in which her hands were hidden  covered this
person from the feet to where it rose behind her neck in a kind of high
ruff-like collar  but in front it was so low or open that it exposed her
large breasts  her skin was darkish and southern and glowing  almost the
colour of honey  some such dress jane had seen worn by a minoan
priestess on a vase from old cnossus  the head  poised motionless on the
muscular pillar of her neck  stared straight at jane  it was a
red-cheeked  wet-lipped face  with black eyes—almost the eyes of a
cow—and an enigmatic expression  it was not by ordinary standards at all
like the face of mother dimble  but jane recognised it at once  it was 
to speak like the musicians  the full statement of that theme which had
elusively haunted mother dimbles face for the last few hours  it was
mother dimbles face with something left out  and the omission shocked
jane  “it is brutal ” she thought  for its energy crushed her  but then
she half changed her mind and thought  “it is i who am weak  trumpery ”
“it is mocking me ” she thought  but then once more changed her mind and
thought  “it is ignoring me  it doesnt see me”  for though there was an
almost ogreish glee in the face  jane did not seem to be invited to
share the joke  she tried to look aside from the face—succeeded—and saw
for the first time that there were other creatures present—four or five
of them—no  more—a whole crowd of ridiculous little men  fat dwarfs in
red caps with tassels on them  chubby  gnome-like little men  quite
insufferably familiar  frivolous  and irrepressible  for there was no
doubt that they  at any rate  were mocking her  they were pointing at
her  nodding  mimicking  standing on their heads  turning somersaults 
jane was not yet frightened  partly because the extreme warmth of the
air at this open window made her feel drowsy  it was really quite
ridiculous for the time of year  her main feeling was one of
indignation  a suspicion which had crossed her mind once or twice
before  now returned to her with irresistible force  the suspicion that
the real universe might be simply silly  it was closely mixed up with
the memories of that grown-up laughter—loud  careless  masculine
laughter on the lips of bachelor uncles—which had often infuriated her
in childhood  and from which the intense seriousness of her school
debating society had offered such a grateful escape 

but a moment later she was very frightened indeed  the giantess rose 
they were all coming at her  with a great glow and a noise like fire the
flame-robed woman and the malapert dwarfs had all come into the house 
they were in the room with her  the strange woman had a torch in her
hand  it burned with terrible  blinding brightness  crackling  and sent
up a cloud of dense black smoke  and filled the bedroom with a sticky 
resinous smell  “if theyre not careful ” thought jane  “theyll set the
house on fire ” but she had hardly time to think of that for her whole
attention was fixed by the outrageous behaviour of the little men  they
began making hay of the room  in a few seconds the bed was a mere chaos 
the sheets on the floor  the blankets snatched up and used by the dwarfs
for tossing the fattest of their company  the pillows hurtling through
the air  feathers flying everywhere  “look out  look out  cant you ”
shouted jane  for the giantess was beginning to touch various parts of
the room with her torch  she touched a vase on the mantelpiece 
instantly there rose from it a streak of colour which jane took for
fire  she was just moving to try to put it out when she saw that the
same thing had happened to a picture on the wall  and then it happened
faster and faster all round her  the very top-knots of the dwarfs were
now on fire  but just as the terror of this became unbearable  jane
noticed that what was curling up from everything the torch had touched
was not flame after all  but vegetation  ivy and honeysuckle were
growing up the legs of the bed  red roses were sprouting from the caps
of the little men  and from every direction huge lilies rose to her
knees and waist  shooting out their yellow tongues at her  the smells 
the heat  the crowding  and the strangeness made her feel faint  it
never occurred to her to think she was dreaming  people mistake dreams
for visions  no one ever mistook a vision for a dream       

“jane  jane ” said the voice of mrs  dimble suddenly  “what on earth is
the matter ”

jane sat up  the room was empty  but the bed had all been pulled to
pieces  she had apparently been lying on the floor  she felt cold and
very tired 

“what  has  happened ” repeated mrs  dimble 

“i dont know ” said jane 

“are you ill  child ” asked mother dimble 

“i must see the director at once ” said jane  “its all right  dont
bother  i can get up by myself       really  but id like to see the
director at once ”


                                  iii

mr  bultitudes mind was as furry and as unhuman in shape as his body 
he did not remember  as a man in his situation would have remembered 
the provincial zoo from which he had escaped during a fire  nor his
first snarling and terrified arrival at the manor  nor the slow stages
whereby he had learned to love and trust its inhabitants  he did not
know that he loved and trusted them now  he did not know that they were
people  nor that he was a bear  indeed he did not know that he existed
at all  everything that is represented by the words  i  and  me  and
 thou  was absent from his mind  when mrs  maggs gave him a tin of
golden syrup  as she did every sunday morning  he did not recognise
either a giver or a recipient  goodness occurred and he tasted it  and
that was all  hence his loves might  if you wished  be all described as
cupboard loves  food and warmth  hands that caressed  voices that
reassured  were their objects  but if by a cupboard love you meant
something cold or calculating you would be quite misunderstanding the
real quality of the beasts sensations  he was no more like a human
egoist than he was like a human altruist  there was no prose in his
life  the appetencies which a human mind might disdain as cupboard loves
were for him quivering and ecstatic aspirations which absorbed his whole
being  infinite yearnings  stabbed with the threat of tragedy and shot
through with the colours of paradise  one of our race  if plunged back
for a moment in the warm  trembling  iridescent pool of that pre-adamite
consciousness  would have emerged believing that he had grasped the
absolute  for the states below reason and the states above it have  by
their common contrast to the life we know  a certain superficial
resemblance  sometimes there returns to us from infancy the memory of a
nameless delight or terror  unattached to any delightful or dreadful
thing  a potent adjective floating in a nounless void  a pure quality 
at such moments we have experience of the shallows of that pool  but
fathoms deeper than any memory can take us  right down in the central
warmth and dimness  the bear lived all its life 

to-day an unusual thing had happened to him—he had got out into the
garden without being muzzled  he was always muzzled out of doors  not
because there was any fear of his becoming dangerous but because of his
partiality for fruit and for the sweeter kinds of vegetables  “tisnt
that hes not tame ” as ivy maggs had explained to jane studdock  “but
that he isnt honest  he wouldnt leave us a thing if we let him have
the run of his teeth ” but to-day the precaution had been forgotten and
the bear had passed a very agreeable morning investigating the turnips 
now—in the early afternoon—he had approached the garden wall  there was
a chestnut tree within the wall which the bear could easily climb  and
from its branches he could drop down on the far side  he was standing
looking up at this tree  mrs  maggs would have described his state of
mind by saying  “he knows perfectly well hes not allowed out of the
garden ” that was not how it appeared to mr  bultitude  he had no
morals  but the director had given him certain inhibitions  a mysterious
reluctance arose  a clouding of the emotional weather  when the wall was
too close  but mixed with this there was an opposite impulse to get
beyond that wall  he did not  of course  know why  and was incapable
even of raising the question  if the pressure behind this impulse could
be translated into human terms at all  it would appear as something more
like a mythology than a thought  one met bees in the garden  but never
found a bee-hive  the bees all went away  over the wall  and to follow
bees was the obvious thing to do  i think there was a sense in the
bears mind—one could hardly call it a picture—of endless green lands
beyond the wall  and hives innumerable  and bees the size of sparrows 
and waiting there  or else walking  trickling  oozing to meet one 
something or someone stickier  sweeter  more golden than honey itself 

to-day  this unrest was upon him in an unusual degree  he was missing
ivy maggs  he did not know that there was any such person and he did not
remember her as we know remembering  but there was an unspecified lack
in his experience  she and the director were  in their different ways 
the two main factors in his existence  he felt  in his own fashion  the
supremacy of the director  meetings with him were to the bear what
mystical experiences are to men  for the director had brought back with
him from venus some shadow of mans lost prerogative to ennoble beasts 
in his presence mr  bultitude trembled on the very borders of
personality  thought the unthinkable and did the impossible  was
troubled and enraptured with gleams from beyond his own woolly world 
and came away tired  but with ivy he was perfectly at home—as a savage
who believes in some remote high god is more at home with the little
deities of wood and water  it was ivy who fed him  chased him out of
forbidden places  cuffed him  and talked to him all day long  it was her
firm conviction that the creature “understood every word she said ” if
you took this literally it was untrue  but in another sense it was not
so wide of the mark  for much of ivys conversation was the expression
not of thought but of feeling  and of feelings mr  bultitude almost
shared—feelings of alacrity  snugness  and physical affection  in their
own way they understood one another pretty well 

three times mr  bultitude turned away from the tree and the wall  but
each time he came back  then  very cautiously and quietly  he began to
climb the tree  when he got up into the fork he sat there for a long
time  he saw beneath him a steep grassy bank descending to a road  the
desire and the inhibition were now both very strong  he sat there for
nearly half an hour  sometimes his mind wandered from the point and once
he nearly went to sleep  in the end he got down on the outside of the
wall  when he found that the thing had really happened he became so
frightened that he sat still at the bottom of the grassy bank on the
very edge of the road  then he heard a noise 

a motor van came into sight  it was driven by a man in the livery of the
n i c e  and another man in the same livery sat beside him 

“hullo       i say ” said the second man  “pull up  sid  what about
 that  ”

“what ” said the driver 

“havent you got eyes in your head ” said the other 

“gor ” said sid  pulling up  “a bloody great bear  i say—it couldnt be
our own bear  could it ”

“get on ” said his mate  “she was in her cage all right this morning ”

“you dont think she could have done a bunk  thered be hell to pay for
you and me       ”

“she couldnt have got here if she  had  done a bunk  bears dont go
forty miles an hour  that aint the point  but hadnt we better pinch
this one ”

“we havent got no orders ” said sid 

“no  and we havent failed to get that blasted wolf either  have we ”

“wasnt our fault  the old woman what said shed sell wouldnt sell  as
youre there to witness  young len  we did our best  told her that
experiments at belbury werent what she thought  told her the brute
would have the time of its life and be made no end of a pet  never told
so many lies in one morning in my life  shed been got at by someone ”

“course it wasnt our fault  but the boss wont take no notice of that 
its get on or get out at belbury ”

“get out ” said sid  “i wish to hell i knew how to ”

len spat over the side and there was a moments silence 

“anyway ” said sid presently  “whats the good of taking a bear back ”

“well  isnt it better than coming back with nothing ” said len  “and
bears cost money  i know they want another one  and here it is free ”

“all right ” said sid ironically  “if youre so keen on it  just hop out
and ask him to step in ”

“dope ” said len 

“not on my bit of dinner  you dont ” said sid 

“youre a bucking good mate to have ” said len  groping in a greasy
parcel  “its a good thing for you im not the sort of chap whod split
on you ”

“you done it already ” said the driver  “i know all your little games ”

len had by this time produced a thick sandwich and was dabbing it with
some strong-smelling liquid from a bottle  when it was thoroughly
saturated  he opened the door and went a pace forward  still holding the
door in one hand  he was now about six yards from the bear  which had
remained perfectly still ever since it saw them  he threw the sandwich
to it 

quarter of an hour later mr  bultitude lay on his side  unconscious and
breathing heavily  they had no difficulty in tying up his mouth and all
four paws  but they had great difficulty in lifting him into the van 

“thats done something to my ticker ” said sid  pressing his hand to his
left side 

“curse your ticker ” said len  rubbing the sweat out of his eyes  “come
on ”

sid climbed back into the driving seat  sat still for a few seconds 
panting and muttering “christ” at intervals  then he started his engine
up and they drove away 


                                   iv

for some time now marks waking life was divided between periods by the
sleepers bedside and periods in the room with the spotted ceiling  the
training in objectivity which took place in the latter cannot be
described fully  the reversal of natural inclination which frost
inculcated was not spectacular or dramatic  but the details would be
unprintable and had  indeed  a kind of nursery fatuity about them which
is best ignored  often mark felt that one good roar of coarse laughter
would have blown away the whole atmosphere of the thing  but laughter
was unhappily out of the question  there indeed lay the horror—to
perform petty obscenities which a very silly child might have thought
funny all under the unchangingly serious inspection of frost  with a
stop watch and a note-book and all the ritual of scientific experiment 
some of the things he had to do were merely meaningless  in one exercise
he had to mount the step-ladder and touch some one spot on the ceiling 
selected by frost  just touch it with his forefinger and then come down
again  but either by association with the other exercises or because it
really concealed some significance  this proceeding always appeared to
mark to be the most indecent and even inhuman of all his tasks  and day
by day  as the process went on  that idea of the straight or the normal
which had occurred to him during his first visit to this room  grew
stronger and more solid in his mind till it became a kind of mountain 
he had never before known what an idea meant  he had always thought till
now that they were things inside ones own head  but now  when his head
was continually attacked and often completely filled with the clinging
corruption of the training  this idea towered up above him—something
which obviously existed quite independently of himself and had hard rock
surfaces which would not give  surfaces he could cling to 

the other thing that helped to save him was the man in the bed  marks
discovery that he really could speak english had led to a curious
acquaintance with him  it can hardly be said that they conversed  both
spoke  but the result was hardly conversation as mark had hitherto
understood the term  the man was so very allusive and used gesture so
extensively that marks less sophisticated modes of communication were
almost useless  thus when mark explained that he had no tobacco  the man
had slapped an imaginary tobacco pouch on his knee at least six times
and struck an imaginary match about as often  each time jerking his head
sideways with a look of such relish as mark had seldom seen on a human
face  then mark went on to explain that though “they” were not
foreigners  they were extremely dangerous people and that probably the
strangers best plan would be to preserve his silence 

“ah ” said the stranger jerking his head again  “ah  eh ” and then 
without exactly laying his finger on his lips he went through an
elaborate pantomime which clearly meant the same thing  and it was
impossible for a long time to get him off this subject  he went back and
back to the theme of secrecy  “ah ” he said  “dont get nothing out of
me  i tell ee  dont get nothing out of me  eh  i tell ee  you and me
knows  ah ” and his look embraced mark in such an apparently gleeful
conspiracy that it warmed the heart  believing this matter to be now
sufficiently clear  mark began  “but  as regards the future—” only to be
met by another pantomime of secrecy  followed by the word “eh ” in a
tone which demanded an answer 

“yes  of course ” said mark  “we are both in considerable danger  and——”

“ah ” said the man  “foreigners  eh ”

“no  no ” said mark  “i told you they werent  they seem to think  you 
are  though  and thats why——”

“thats right ” interrupted the man  “i know  foreigners  i call them  i
know  they get nothing out of me  you and mes all right  ah ”

“ive been trying to think out some sort of plan ” said mark 

“ah ” said the man approvingly 

“and i was wondering ” began mark when the man suddenly leaned forwards
and said with extraordinary energy “i tell ee ”

“what ” said mark 

“i got a plan ”

“what is it ”

“ah ” said the man winking at mark with infinite knowingness and rubbing
his belly 

“go on  what is it ” said mark 

“howd it be ” said the man  sitting up and applying his left thumb to
his right forefinger as if about to propound the first step in a
philosophical argument  “howd it be now if you and i made ourselves a
nice bit of toasted cheese ”

“i meant a plan for escape ” said mark 

“ah ” replied the man  “my old dad  now  he never had a days illness in
his life  eh  hows that for a bit of all right  eh ”

“its a remarkable record ” said mark 

“ah  you may say so ” replied the other  “on the road all his life 
never had a stomach-ache  eh ” and here  as if mark might not know that
malady  he went through a long and extraordinarily vivid dumb show 

“open-air life suited him  i suppose ” said mark 

“and what did he attribute his health to ” asked the man  he pronounced
the word  attribute  with great relish  laying the accent on the first
syllable  “i ask everyone  what did he attribute his health to ”

mark was about to reply when the man indicated by a gesture that the
question was purely rhetorical and that he did not wish to be
interrupted 

“he attributed his health ” continued the speaker with great solemnity 
“to eating toasted cheese  keeps the water out of the stomach  thats
what it does  eh  makes a lining  stands to reason  ah ”

in several later interviews mark endeavoured to discover something of
the strangers own history and particularly how he had been brought to
belbury  this was not easy to do  for though the tramps conversation
was very autobiographical  it was filled almost entirely with accounts
of conversations in which he had made stunning repartees whose points
remained wholly obscure  even where it was less intellectual in
character  the allusions were too difficult for mark  who was quite
ignorant of the life of the roads though he had once written a very
authoritative article on vagrancy  but by repeated and  as he got to
know his man  more cautious questioning  he couldnt help getting the
idea that the tramp had been made to give up his clothes to a total
stranger and then put to sleep  he never got the story in so many words 
the tramp insisted on talking as if mark knew it already  and any
pressure for a more accurate account produced only a series of nods 
winks  and highly confidential gestures  as for the identity or
appearance of the person who had taken his clothes  nothing whatever
could be made out  the nearest mark ever got to it  after hours of talk
and deep potations  was some such statement as “ah  he was a one ” or
“he was a kind of—eh   you  know ” or “that was a customer  that was ”
these statements were made with enormous gusto as though the theft of
the tramps clothes had excited his deepest admiration 

indeed  throughout the mans conversation this gusto was the most
striking characteristic  he never passed any kind of moral judgement on
the various things that had been done to him in the course of his
career  nor did he ever try to explain them  much that was unjust and
still more that was simply unintelligible seemed to be accepted not only
without resentment but with a certain satisfaction provided only that it
was striking  even about his present situation he showed very much less
curiosity than mark would have thought possible  it did not make sense 
but then the man did not expect things to make sense  he deplored the
absence of tobacco and regarded the “foreigners” as very dangerous
people  but the main thing  obviously  was to eat and drink as much as
possible while the present conditions lasted  and gradually mark fell
into line  the mans breath  and indeed his body  were malodorous  and
his methods of eating were gross  but the sort of continual picnic which
the two shared carried mark back into that realm of childhood which we
have all enjoyed before nicety began  each understood perhaps an eighth
part of what the other said  but a kind of intimacy grew between them 
mark never noticed until years later that here  where there was no room
for vanity and no more power or security than that of “children playing
in a giants kitchen ” he had unawares become a member of a “circle ” as
secret and as strongly fenced against outsiders as any that he had
dreamed of 

every now and then their  téte-à-téte  was interrupted  frost or wither
or both would come in introducing some stranger who addressed the tramp
in an unknown language  failed completely to get any response  and was
ushered out again  the tramps habit of submission to the
unintelligible  mixed with a kind of animal cunning  stood him in good
stead during these interviews  even without marks advice  it would
never have occurred to him to undeceive his captors by replying in
english  undeceiving was an activity wholly foreign to his mind  for the
rest  his expression of tranquil indifference  varied occasionally by
extremely sharp looks but never by the least sign of anxiety or
bewilderment  left his interrogators mystified  wither could never find
in his face the evil he was looking for  but neither could he find any
of that virtue which would  for him  have been the danger signal  the
tramp was a type of man he had never met  the dupe  the terrified
victim  the toady  the would-be accomplice  the rival  the honest man
with loathing and hatred in his eyes  were all familiar to him  but not
this 

and then  one day  there came an interview that was different 


                                   v

“it sounds rather like a mythological picture by titian come to life ”
said the director with a smile  when jane had described her experience
in the lodge 

“yes  but      ” said jane  and then stopped  “i see ” she began again 
“it was very like that  not only the woman and the       the
dwarfs       but the glow  as if the air were on fire  but i always
thought i liked titian  i suppose i wasnt really taking the pictures
seriously enough  just chattering about the renaissance the way one
did ”

“you didnt like it when it came out into real life ”

jane shook her head 

“was it real  sir ” she asked presently  “are there such things ”

“yes ” said the director  “it was real enough  oh  there are thousands
of things within this square mile that i dont know about yet  and i
dare say that the presence of merlinus brings out certain things  we are
not living  exactly  in the twentieth century as long as hes here  we
overlap a bit  the focus is blurred  and you yourself       you are a
seer  you were perhaps bound to meet her  shes what youll get if you
wont have the other ”

“how do you mean  sir ” said jane 

“you said she was a little like mother dimble  so she is  but mother
dimble with something left out  mother dimble is friends with all that
world as merlinus is friends with the woods and rivers  but he isnt a
wood or a river himself  she has not rejected it  but she has baptized
it  she is a christian wife  and you  you know  are not  neither are you
a virgin  you have put yourself where you must meet that old woman and
you have rejected all that has happened to her since maleldil came to
earth  so you get her raw—not stronger than mother dimble would find
her  but untransformed  demoniac  and you dont like it  hasnt that
been the history of your life ”

“you mean ” said jane slowly  “ive been repressing something ”

the director laughed  just that loud  assured  bachelor laughter which
had often infuriated her on other lips 

“yes ” he said  “but dont think im talking of freudian repressions  he
knew only half the facts  it isnt a question of inhibitions—inculcated
shame—against natural desire  im afraid theres no niche in the world
for people that wont be either pagan or christian  just imagine a man
who was too dainty to eat with his fingers and yet wouldnt use forks ”

his laughter rather than his words had reddened janes cheeks  and she
was staring at him open-mouthed  assuredly the director was not in the
least like mother dimble  but an odious realisation that he was  in this
matter  on mother dimbles side—that he also  though he did not belong
to that hot-coloured  archaic world  stood somehow in good diplomatic
relations with it  from which she was excluded—had struck her like a
blow  some old female dream of finding a man who “really understood” was
being insulted  she took it for granted  half unconsciously  that the
director was the most virginal of his sex  but she had not realised that
this would leave his masculinity still on the other side of the stream
from herself and even steeper  more emphatic  than that of common men 
some knowledge of a world beyond nature she had already gained from
living in his house  and more from fear of death that night in the
dingle  but she had been conceiving this world as “spiritual” in the
negative sense—as some neutral  or democratic  vacuum where differences
disappeared  where sex and sense were not transcended but simply taken
away  now the suspicion dawned upon her that there might be differences
and contrasts all the way up  richer  sharper  even fiercer  at every
rung of the ascent  how if this invasion of her own being in marriage
from which she had recoiled  often in the very teeth of instinct  were
not  as she had supposed  merely a relic of animal life or patriarchal
barbarism  but rather the lowest  the first  and the easiest form of
some shocking contact with reality which would have to be repeated—but
in ever larger and more disturbing modes—on the highest levels of all 

“yes ” said the director  “there is no escape  if it were a virginal
rejection of the male  he would allow it  such souls can by-pass the
male and go on to meet something far more masculine  higher up  to which
they must make a yet deeper surrender  but your trouble has been what
old poets called  daungier   we call it pride  you are offended by the
masculine itself  the loud  irruptive  possessive thing—the gold lion 
the bearded bull—which breaks through hedges and scatters the little
kingdom of your primness as the dwarfs scattered the carefully made bed 
the male you could have escaped  for it exists only on the biological
level  but the masculine none of us can escape  what is above and beyond
all things is so masculine that we are all feminine in relation to it 
you had better agree with your adversary quickly ”

“you mean i shall have to become a christian ” said jane 

“it looks like it ” said the director 

“but—i still dont see what that had to do with       with mark ” said
jane  this was perhaps not perfectly true  the vision of the universe
which she had begun to see in the last few minutes had a curiously
stormy quality about it  it was bright  darting  and overpowering  old
testament imagery of eyes and wheels for the first time in her life took
on some possibility of meaning  and mixed with this was the sense that
she had been manœuvred into a false position  it ought to have been she
who was saying these things to the christians  hers ought to have been
the vivid  perilous world brought against their grey formalised one 
hers the quick  vital movements and theirs the stained-glass attitudes 
that was the antithesis she was used to  this time  in a sudden flash of
purple and crimson  she remembered what stained glass was really like 
and where mark stood in all this new world she did not know  certainly
not quite in his old place  something which she liked to think of as the
opposite of mark had been taken away  something civilised  or modern  or
scholarly  or  of late  spiritual which did not want to possess her 
which valued her for the odd collection of qualities she called
“herself ” something without hands that gripped and without demands upon
her  but if there were no such thing  playing for time  she asked 

“who was that huge woman ”

“im not sure ” said the director  “but i think i can make a guess  did
you know that all the planets are represented in each ”

“no  sir  i didnt ”

“apparently they are  there is no oyarsa in heaven who has not got his
representative on earth  and there is no world where you could not meet
a little unfallen partner of our own black archon  a kind of other self 
that is why there was an italian saturn as well as a heavenly one  and a
cretan jove as well as an olympian  it was these earthly wraiths of the
high intelligences that men met in old times when they reported that
they had seen the gods  it was with those that a man like merlin was  at
times  conversant  nothing from beyond the moon ever really descended 
what concerns you more  there is a terrestrial as well as a celestial
venus—perelandras wraith as well as perelandra ”

“and you think       ”

“i do  i have long known that this house is deeply under her influence 
there is even copper in the soil  also—the earth-venus will be specially
active here at present  for it is to-night that her heavenly archtype
will really descend ”

“i had forgotten ” said jane 

“you will not forget it once it has happened  all of you had better stay
together—in the kitchen  perhaps  do not come upstairs  to-night i will
bring merlin before my masters  all five of them—viritrilbia 
perelandra  malacandra  glund  and lurga  he will be opened  powers will
pass into him ”

“what will he  do   sir ”

the director laughed  “the first step is easy  the enemies at belbury
are already looking for experts in archaic western dialects  preferably
celtic  we shall send them an interpreter  yes  by the splendour of
christ  we will send them one  upon them he a spirit of frenzy sent to
call in haste for their destroyer  they have advertised in the papers
for one  and after the first step       well  you know  it will be easy 
in fighting those who serve devils one always has this on ones side 
their masters hate them as much as they hate us  the moment we disable
the human pawns enough to make them useless to hell  their own masters
finish the work for us  they break their tools ”

there was a sudden knock on the door and grace ironwood entered 

“ivy is back  sir ” she said  “i think youd better see her  no  shes
alone  she never saw her husband  the sentence is over but they havent
released him  hes been sent on to belbury for remedial treatment  under
some new regulation  apparently it does not require a sentence from a
court       but shes not very coherent  she is in great distress ”


                                   vi

jane had gone into the garden to think  she accepted what the director
had said  yet it seemed to her nonsensical  his comparison between
marks love and gods  since apparently there was a god  struck her
nascent spirituality as indecent and irreverent  “religion” ought to
mean a realm in which her haunting female fear of being treated as a
thing  an object of barter and desire and possession  would be set
permanently at rest  and what she called her “true self” would soar
upwards and expand in some freer and purer world  for still she thought
that “religion” was a kind of exhalation or a cloud of incense 
something steaming up from specially gifted souls towards a receptive
heaven  then  quite sharply  it occurred to her that the director never
talked about religion  nor did the dimbles nor camilla  they talked
about god  they had no picture in their minds of some mist steaming
upward  rather of strong  skilful hands thrust down to make and mend 
perhaps even to destroy  supposing one were a  thing  after all—a thing
designed and invented by someone else and valued for qualities quite
different from what one had decided to regard as ones true self 
supposing all those people who  from the bachelor uncles down to mark
and mother dimble  had infuriatingly found her sweet and fresh when she
wanted them to find her also interesting and important  had all along
been simply right and perceived the sort of thing she was  supposing
maleldil on this subject agreed with them and not with her  for one
moment she had a ridiculous and scorching vision of a world in which god
himself would never understand  never take her with full seriousness 
then  at one particular corner of the gooseberry patch  the change came 

what awaited her there was serious to the degree of sorrow and beyond 
there was no form nor sound  the mould under the bushes  the moss on the
path  and the little brick border  were not visibly changed  but they
were changed  a boundary had been crossed  she had come into a world  or
into a person  or into the presence of a person  something expectant 
patient  inexorable  met her with no veil or protection between  in the
closeness of that contact she perceived at once that the directors
words had been entirely misleading  this demand which now pressed upon
her was not  even by analogy  like any other demand  it was the origin
of all right demands and contained them  in its light you could
understand them  but from them you could know nothing of it  there was
nothing  and never had been anything  like this  and now there was
nothing except this  yet also  everything had been like this  only by
being like this had anything existed  in this height and depth and
breadth the little idea of herself which she had hitherto called  me 
dropped down and vanished  unfluttering  into bottomless distance  like
a bird in space without air  the name  me  was the name of a being whose
existence she had never suspected  a being that did not yet fully exist
but which was demanded  it was a person  not the person she had thought 
yet also a thing—a made thing  made to please another and in him to
please all others—a thing being made at this very moment  without its
choice  in a shape it had never dreamed of  and the making went on
amidst a kind of splendour or sorrow or both  whereof she could not tell
whether it was in the moulding hands or in the kneaded lump 

words take too long  to be aware of all this and to know that it had
already gone made one single experience  it was revealed only in its
departure  the largest thing that had ever happened to her had 
apparently  found room for itself in a moment of time too short to be
called time at all  her hand closed on nothing but a memory  and as it
closed  without an instants pause  the voices of those who have not joy
rose howling and chattering from every corner of her being 

“take care  draw back  keep your head  dont commit yourself ” they
said  and then more subtly  from another quarter  “you have had a
religious experience  this is very interesting  not everyone does  how
much better you will now understand the seventeenth century poets ” or
from a third direction  more sweetly  “go on  try to get it again  it
will please the director ”

but her defences had been captured and these counter-attacks were
unsuccessful 




                                fifteen

all the house at st  annes was empty  but for two rooms  in the
kitchen  drawn a little closer than usual about the fire and with the
shutters closed  sat dimble and macphee and denniston and the women 
removed from them by many a long vacancy of stair and passage  the
pendragon and merlin were together in the blue room 

if anyone had gone up the stairs and onto the lobby outside the blue
room  he would have found something other than fear that barred his
way—an almost physical resistance  if he had succeeded in forcing his
way forward against it  he would have come into a region of tingling
sounds that were clearly not voices though they had articulation  and if
the passage were quite dark he would probably have seen a faint light 
not like fire or moon  under the directors door  i do not think he
could have reached the door itself unbidden  already the whole house
would have seemed to him to be tilting and plunging like a ship in a bay
of biscay gale  he would have been horribly compelled to feel this earth
not as the base of the universe but as a ball spinning and rolling
onwards  both at delirious speed  and not through emptiness but through
some densely inhabited and intricately structured medium  he would have
known sensuously  until his outraged senses forsook him  that the
visitants in that room were in it not because they were at rest but
because they glanced and wheeled through the packed reality of heaven
 which men call empty space  to keep their beams upon this spot of the
moving earths hide 

the druid and ransom had begun to wait for these visitors soon after
sundown  ransom was on his sofa  merlin sat beside him  his hands
clasped  his body a little bent forward  sometimes a drop of sweat
trickled coldly down his grey cheek  he had at first addressed himself
to kneel but ransom forbade him  “see thou do it not ” he had said 
“have you forgotten that they are our fellow-servants ” the windows were
uncurtained  and all the light that there was in the room came thence 
frosty-red when they began their waiting  but later star-lit 

long before anything happened in the blue room the party in the kitchen
had made their ten oclock tea  it was while they sat drinking it that
the change occurred  up till now they had instinctively been talking in
subdued voices  as children talk in a room where their elders are busied
about some august incomprehensible matter  a funeral  or the reading of
a will  now of a sudden they all began talking loudly at once  each  not
contentiously but delightedly  interrupting the others  a stranger
coming into the kitchen would have thought they were drunk  not soddenly
but gaily drunk  would have seen heads bent close together  eyes
dancing  an excited wealth of gesture  what they said  none of the party
could ever afterwards remember  dimble maintained that they had been
chiefly engaged in making puns  macphee denied that he had ever  even
that night  made a pun  but all agreed that they had been
extraordinarily witty  if not plays upon words  yet certainly plays upon
thoughts  paradoxes  fancies  anecdotes  theories laughingly advanced 
yet  on consideration  well worth taking seriously  had flowed from them
and over them with dazzling prodigality  even ivy forgot her great
sorrow  mother dimble always remembered denniston and her husband as
they had stood  one on each side of the fireplace  in a gay intellectual
duel  each capping the other  each rising above the other  up and up 
like birds or aeroplanes in combat  if only one could have remembered
what they said  for never in her life had she heard such talk—such
eloquence  such melody  song could have added nothing to it   such
toppling structures of double meaning  such sky-rockets of metaphor and
allusion 

a moment after that and they were all silent  calm fell  as suddenly as
when one goes out of the wind behind a wall  they sat staring upon one
another  tired and a little self-conscious 

upstairs this first change had had a different operation  there came an
instant at which both men braced themselves  ransom gripped the side of
his sofa  merlin grasped his own knees and set his teeth  a rod of
coloured light  whose colour no man can name or picture  darted between
them  no more to see than that  but seeing was the least part of their
experience  quick agitation seized them  a kind of boiling and bubbling
in mind and heart which shook their bodies also  it went to a rhythm of
such fierce speed that they feared their sanity must be shaken into a
thousand fragments  and then it seemed that this had actually happened 
but it did not matter  for all the fragments—needle-pointed desires 
brisk merriments  lynx-eyed thoughts—went rolling to and fro like
glittering drops and reunited themselves  it was well that both men had
some knowledge of poetry  the doubling  splitting  and recombining of
thoughts which now went on in them would have been unendurable for one
whom that art had not already instructed in the counterpoint of the
mind  the mastery of doubled and trebled vision  for ransom  whose study
had been for many years in the realm of words  it was heavenly pleasure 
he found himself sitting within the very heart of language  in the
white-hot furnace of essential speech  all fact was broken  splashed
into cataracts  caught  turned inside out  kneaded  slain  and reborn as
meaning  for the lord of meaning himself  the herald  the messenger  the
slayer of argus  was with them  the angel that spins nearest the sun 
viritrilbia  whom men call mercury and thoth 

down in the kitchen drowsiness stole over them after the orgy of
speaking had come to an end  jane  having nearly fallen asleep  was
startled by her book falling from her hand  and looked about her  how
warm it was       how comfortable and familiar  she had always liked
wood fires  but to-night the smell of the logs seemed more than
ordinarily sweet  she began to think it was sweeter than it could
possibly be  that a smell of burning cedar or of incense pervaded the
room  it thickened  fragrant names hovered in her mind—nard and cassias
balmy smells and all arabia breathing from a box  even something more
subtly sweet  perhaps maddening—why not forbidden —but she knew it was
commanded  she was too drowsy to think deeply how this could be  the
dimbles were talking together  but in so low a voice that the rest could
not hear  their faces appeared to her transfigured  she could no longer
see that they were old—only mature  like ripe fields in august  serene
and golden with the tranquillity of fulfilled desire  on her other side 
arthur said something in camillas ear  there too       but as the
warmth and sweetness of that rich air now fully mastered her brain  she
could hardly bear to look on them  not through envy  that thought was
far away  but because a sort of brightness flowed from them that dazzled
her  as if the god and goddess in them burned through their bodies and
through their clothes and shone before her in a young double-natured
nakedness of rose-red spirit that overcame her  and all about them
danced  as she half saw  not the gross and ridiculous dwarfs which she
had seen that afternoon but grave and ardent spirits  bright winged 
their boyish shapes smooth and slender like ivory rods 

in the blue room also ransom and merlin felt about this time that the
temperature had risen  the windows  they did not see how or when  had
swung open  at their opening the temperature did not drop  for it was
from without that the warmth came  through the bare branches  across the
ground which was once more stiffening with frost  a summer breeze was
blowing into the room  but the breeze of such a summer as england never
has  laden like heavy barges that glide nearly gunwale under  laden so
heavily you would have thought it could not move  laden with ponderous
fragrance of night-scented flowers  sticky gums  groves that drop
odours  and with cool savour of midnight fruit  it stirred the curtains 
it lifted a letter that lay on the table  it lifted the hair which had a
moment before been plastered on merlins forehead  the room was rocking 
they were afloat  a soft tingling and shivering as of foam and breaking
bubbles ran over their flesh  tears ran down ransoms cheeks  he alone
knew from what seas and what islands that breeze blew  merlin did not 
but in him also the inconsolable wound with which man is born waked and
ached at this touching  low syllables of prehistoric celtic self-pity
murmured from his lips  these yearnings and fondlings were  however 
only the forerunners of the goddess  as the whole of her virtue seized 
focused  and held that spot of the rolling earth in her long beam 
something harder  shriller  more perilously ecstatic  came out of the
centre of all the softness  both the humans trembled—merlin because he
did not know what was coming  ransom because he knew  and now it came 
it was fiery  sharp  bright  and ruthless  ready to kill  ready to die 
outspeeding light  it was charity  not as mortals imagine it  not even
as it has been humanised for them since the incarnation of the word  but
the translunary virtue  fallen upon them direct from the third heaven 
unmitigated  they were blinded  scorched  deafened  they thought it
would burn their bones  they could not bear that it should continue 
they could not bear that it should cease  so perelandra  triumphant
among planets  whom men call venus  came and was with them in the room 

down in the kitchen macphee sharply drew back his chair so that it
grated on the tiled floor like a pencil squeaking on a slate  “man ” he
exclaimed  “its a shame for us to be sitting here looking at the fire 
if the director hadnt got a game leg himself  ill bet you hed have
found some other way for us to go to work ”

camillas eyes flashed towards him  “go on ” she said  “go on ”

“what do you mean  macphee ” said dimble 

“he means fighting ” said camilla 

“theyd be too many for us  im afraid ” said arthur denniston 

“maybe so ” said macphee  “but maybe theyll be too many for us this
way  too  but it would be grand to have one go at them before the end 
to tell you the truth  i sometimes feel i dont greatly care what
happens  but i wouldnt be easy in my grave if i knew theyd won and id
never had my hands on them  id like to be able to say as an old
sergeant said to me in the first war  about a bit of a raid we did near
monchy  our fellows did it all with the butt end  you know  sir  says
he  did ever you hear anything like the way their heads cracked ”

“i think thats disgusting ” said mother dimble 

“that part is  i suppose ” said camilla  “but       oh  if one could
have a charge in the old style  i dont mind anything once im on a
horse ”

“i cant understand it ” said dimble  “im not like you  macphee  im
not brave  but i was just thinking as you spoke that i dont feel afraid
of being killed and hurt as i used to do  not to-night ”

“we may be  i suppose ” said jane 

“as long as were all together ” said mother dimble  “it might be      
no  i dont mean anything heroic       it might be a  nice  way to die ”
and suddenly all their faces and voices were changed  they were laughing
again  but it was a different kind of laughter  their love for one
another became intense  each  looking on all the rest  thought  “im
lucky to be here  i could die with these ” but macphee was humming to
himself 

“king william said  be not dismayed  for the loss of one commander ”

upstairs it was  at first  much the same  merlin saw in memory the
wintry grass on badon hill  the long banner of the virgin fluttering
above the heavy british-roman cataphracts  the yellow-haired barbarians 
he heard the snap of the bows  the  click-click  of steel points in
wooden shields  the cheers  the howling  the ringing of struck mail  he
remembered also the evening  fires twinkling along the hill  frost
making the gashes smart  starlight on a pool fouled with blood  eagles
crowding together in the pale sky  and ransom  it may be  remembered his
long struggle in the caves of perelandra  but all this passed  something
tonic and lusty and cheerily cold  like a sea-breeze  was coming over
them  there was no fear anywhere  the blood inside them flowed as if to
a marching-song  they felt themselves taking their places in the ordered
rhythm of the universe  side by side with punctual seasons and patterned
atoms and the obeying seraphim  under the immense weight of their
obedience their wills stood up straight and untiring like caryatides 
eased of all fickleness and all protestings they stood  gay  light 
nimble  and alert  they had outlived all anxieties  care was a word
without meaning  to live was to share without effort this processional
romp  ransom knew  as a man knows when he touches iron  the clear  taut
splendour of that celestial spirit who now flashed between them 
vigilant malacandra  captain of a cold orb  whom men call mars and
mavors  and tyr who put his hand in the wolf-mouth  ransom greeted his
guests in the tongue of heaven  but he warned merlin that now the time
was coming when he must play the man  the three gods who had already met
in the blue room were less unlike humanity than the two whom they still
awaited  in viritrilbia and venus and malacandra were represented those
two of the seven genders which bear a certain analogy to the biological
sexes  and can therefore be in some measure understood by men  it would
not be so with those who were now preparing to descend  these also
doubtless had their genders  but we have no clue to them  these would be
mightier energies  ancient eldils  steersmen of giant worlds which have
never from the beginning been subdued to the sweet humiliations of
organic life 

“stir the fire  denniston  for any sake  thats a cold night ” said
macphee in the kitchen 

“it must be cold outside ” said dimble 

all thought of that  of stiff grass  hen-roosts  dark places in the
middle of woods  graves  then of the suns dying  the earth gripped 
suffocated  in airless cold  the black sky lit only with stars  and
then  not even stars  the heat-death of the universe  utter and final
blackness of nonentity from which nature knows no return  another life 
“possibly ” thought macphee  “i believe ” thought denniston  but the old
life gone  all its times  all its hours and days  gone  can even
omnipotence  bring back   where do years go  and why  man never would
understand it  the misgiving deepened  perhaps there was nothing to be
understood 

saturn  whose name in the heavens is lurga  stood in the blue room  his
spirit lay upon the house  or even on the whole earth  with a cold
pressure such as might flatten the very orb of tellus to a wafer 
matched against the lead-like burden of his antiquity  the other gods
themselves perhaps felt young and ephemeral  it was a mountain of
centuries sloping up from the highest antiquity we can conceive  up and
up like a mountain whose summit never comes into sight  not to eternity
where the thought can rest  but into more and still more time  into
freezing wastes and silence of unnameable numbers  it was also strong
like a mountain  its age was no mere morass of time where imagination
can sink in reverie  but a living  self-remembering duration which
repelled lighter intelligences from its structure as granite flings back
waves  itself unwithered and undecayed  but able to wither any who
approached it unadvised  ransom and merlin suffered a sensation of
unendurable cold  and all that was strength in lurga became sorrow as it
entered them  yet lurga in that room was overmatched  suddenly a greater
spirit came—one whose influence tempered and almost transformed to his
own quality the skill of leaping mercury  the clearness of mars  the
subtler vibration of venus  and even the numbing weight of saturn 

in the kitchen his coming was felt  no one afterwards knew how it
happened  but somehow the kettle was put on  the hot toddy was brewed 
arthur—the only musician among them—was bidden to get out his fiddle 
the chairs were pushed back  the floor cleared  they danced  what they
danced no one could remember  it was some round dance  no modern
shuffling  it involved beating the floor  clapping of hands  leaping
high  and no one  while it lasted  thought himself or his fellows
ridiculous  it may  in fact  have been some village measure  not
ill-suited to the tiled kitchen  the spirit in which they danced it was
not so  it seemed to each that the room was filled with kings and
queens  that the wildness of their dance expressed heroic energy  and
its quieter movements had seized the very spirit behind all noble
ceremonies 

upstairs his mighty beam turned the blue room into a blaze of lights 
before the other angels a man might sink  before this he might die  but
if he lived at all he would laugh  if you had caught one breath of the
air that came from him  you would have felt yourself taller than before 
though you were a cripple  your walk would have become stately  though a
beggar  you would have worn your rags magnanimously  kingship and power
and festal pomp and courtesy shot from him as sparks fly from an anvil 
the ringing of bells  the blowing of trumpets  the spreading out of
banners  are means used on earth to make a faint symbol of his quality 
it was like a long sunlit wave  creamy-crested and arched with emerald 
that comes on nine feet tall  with roaring and with terror and
unquenchable laughter  it was like the first beginning of music in the
halls of some king so high and at some festival so solemn that a tremor
akin to fear runs through young hearts when they hear it  for this was
great glund-oyarsa  king of kings  through whom the joy of creation
principally blows across these fields of arbol  known to men in old
times as jove and under that name  by fatal but not inexplicable
misprision  confused with his maker—so little did they dream by how many
degrees the stair even of created being rises above him 

at his coming there was holiday in the blue room  the two mortals 
momentarily caught up into the  gloria  which those five excellent
natures perpetually sing  forgot for a time the lower and more immediate
purpose of their meeting  then they proceeded to operation  merlin
received the powers into him 

he looked different next day  partly because his beard had been shaved 
but also  because he was no longer his own man  no one doubted that his
final severance from the body was near  later in the day macphee drove
him off and dropped him in the neighbourhood of belbury 


                                   ii

mark had fallen into a doze in the tramps bedroom that day  when he was
startled  and driven suddenly to collect himself  by the arrival of
visitors  frost came in first and held the door open  two others
followed  one was the deputy director  the other was a man whom mark had
not seen before 

this person was dressed in a rusty cassock and carried in his hand a
wide-brimmed black hat such as priests wear in many parts of the
continent  he was a very big man  and the cassock perhaps made him look
bigger  he was clean shaven  revealing a large face with heavy and
complicated folds in it  and he walked with his head a little bowed 
mark decided that he was a simple soul  probably an obscure member of
some religious order who happened to be an authority on some even more
obscure language  and it was to mark rather odious to see him standing
between those two birds of prey—wither effusive and flattering on his
right and frost  on his left  stiff as a ramrod  waiting with scientific
attention but also  as mark could now see  with a certain cold dislike 
for the result of the new experiment 

wither talked to the stranger for some moments in a language which mark
could not follow but which he recognised as latin  “a priest 
obviously ” thought mark  “but i wonder where from  wither knows most of
the ordinary languages  would the old chap be a greek  doesnt look like
a levantine  more probably a russian ” but at this point marks
attention was diverted  the tramp  who had closed his eyes when he heard
the door-handle turning  had suddenly opened them  seen the stranger 
and then shut them tighter than before  after this his behaviour was
peculiar  he began emitting a series of very exaggerated snores and
turned his back to the company  the stranger took a step nearer to the
bed and spoke two syllables in a low voice  for a second or two the
tramp lay as he was but seemed to be afflicted with a shivering fit 
then  slowly  but with continuous movement  as when the bows of a ship
come round in obedience to the rudder  he rolled round and lay staring
up into the others face  his mouth and his eyes were both opened very
wide  from certain jerking of his head and hands and from certain
ghastly attempts to smile  mark concluded that he was trying to say
something  probably of a deprecatory and insinuating kind  what next
followed took his breath away  the stranger spoke again  and then  with
much facial contortion  mixed with coughs and stammers and spluttering
and expectoration  there came out of the tramps mouth  in a high
unnatural voice  syllables  words  a whole sentence  in some language
that was neither latin nor english  all this time the stranger kept his
eyes fixed on those of the tramp 

the stranger spoke again  this time the tramp replied at much greater
length and seemed to manage the unknown language a little more easily 
though his voice remained quite unlike that in which mark had heard him
talking for the last few days  at the end of his speech he sat up in bed
and pointed to where wither and frost were standing  then the stranger
appeared to ask him a question  the tramp spoke for the third time 

at this reply the stranger started back  crossed himself several times 
and exhibited every sign of terror  he turned and spoke rapidly in latin
to the other two  something happened to their faces when he spoke  they
looked like dogs who have just picked up a scent  then  with a loud
exclamation the stranger caught up his skirts and made a bolt for the
door  but the scientists were too quick for him  for a few minutes all
three were wrangling there  frosts teeth bared like an animals  and
the loose mask of withers face wearing  for once  a quite unambiguous
expression  the old priest was being threatened  mark found that he
himself had taken a step forward  but before he could make up his mind
how to act  the stranger  shaking his head and holding out his hands 
had come timidly back to the bedside  it was an odd thing that the tramp
who had relaxed during the struggle at the door should suddenly stiffen
again and fix his eyes on this frightened old man as if he were awaiting
orders 

more words in the unknown language followed  the tramp once more pointed
at wither and frost  the stranger turned and spoke to them in latin 
apparently translating  wither and frost looked at one another as if
each waited for his fellow to act  what followed was pure lunacy  with
infinite caution  wheezing and creaking  down went the whole shaky
senility of the deputy director  down onto its knees  and half a second
later with a jerky  metallic movement frost got down beside him  when he
was down he suddenly looked over his shoulder to where mark was
standing  the flash of pure hatred in his face  but hatred  as it were 
crystallised so that it was no longer a passion and had no heat in it 
was like touching metal in the arctic where metal burns  “kneel ” he
bleated  and instantly turned his head  mark never could remember
afterwards whether he simply forgot to obey this order or whether his
real rebellion dated from that moment 

the tramp spoke again  always with his eyes fixed on those of the man in
the cassock  and again the latter translated  and then stood aside 
wither and frost began going forward on their knees till they reached
the bedside  the tramps hairy  dirty hand with its bitten nails was
thrust out to them  they kissed it  then it seemed that some further
order was given them  they rose and mark perceived that wither was
gently expostulating in latin against this order  he kept on indicating
frost  the words  venia tua  [4]  each time emended to  venia vestra  
recurred so often that mark could pick them out  but apparently the
expostulation was unsuccessful  a few moments later frost and wither had
both left the room 

as the door shut  the tramp collapsed like a deflated balloon  he rolled
himself to and fro on the bed muttering  “gor  blimey  couldnt have
believed it  its a knock-out  a fair knock-out ” but mark had little
leisure to attend to this  he found that the stranger was addressing
him  and though he could not understand the words  he looked up 
instantly he wished to look away again and found that he could not  he
might have claimed with some reason that he was by now an expert in the
endurance of alarming faces  but that did not alter the fact that when
he looked on this he felt himself afraid  almost before he had time to
realise this he felt himself drowsy  a moment later he fell into his
chair and slept 


                                  iii

“well ” said frost  as soon as they found themselves outside the door 

“it is       er       profoundly perplexing ” said the deputy director 

they walked down the passage conversing in low tones as they went 

“it certainly looked—i say  looked  ” continued frost  “as if the man in
the bed were being hypnotised and the basque priest were in charge of
the situation ”

“oh  surely  my dear friend  that would be a most disquieting
hypothesis ”

“excuse me  i have made no hypothesis  i am describing how it looked ”

“and how  on your hypothesis—forgive me  but that is what it is—would a
basque priest come to invent the story that our guest was merlinus
ambrosius ”

“that is the point  if the man in the bed is  not  merlinus  then
someone else  and someone quite outside our calculations  namely the
priest  knows our whole plan of campaign ”

“and that  my dear friend  is why the retention of both these persons
and a certain extreme delicacy in our attitude to both is required—at
least until we have some further light ”

“they must  of course  be detained ”

“i would hardly say  detained   it has implications       i do not
venture to express any doubts at present as to the identity of our
distinguished guest  there is no question of detention  on the contrary 
the most cordial welcome  the most meticulous courtesy      ”

“do i understand that you had always pictured merlinus entering the
institute as a dictator rather than a colleague ”

“as to that ” said wither  “my conception of the personal  or even
official  relations between us had always been elastic and ready for all
necessary adaptations  it would be a very real grief to me if i thought
you were allowing any misplaced sense of your own dignity       ah  in
short  provided he  is  merlinus       you understand me ”

“where are you taking us at the moment ”

“to my own apartments  if you remember  the request was that we should
provide our guest with some clothes ”

“there was no request  we were ordered ”

to this the deputy director made no reply  when both men were in his
bedroom and the door was shut  frost said  “i am not satisfied  you do
not seem to realise the dangers of the situation  we must take into
account the possibility that the man is not merlinus  and if he is not
merlinus  then the priest knows things he ought not to know  to allow an
impostor and a spy to remain at large in the institute is out of the
question  we must find out at once where that priest gets his knowledge
from  and where did you get the priest from ”

“i think that is the kind of shirt which would be most suitable ” said
wither  laying it on the bed  “the suits are in here  the       ah      
clerical personage said he had come in answer to our advertisement  i
wish to do full justice to the point of view you have expressed  my dear
frost  on the other hand  to reject the real merlinus       to alienate
a power which is an integral factor in our plan       would be at least
equally dangerous  it is not even certain that the priest would in any
event be an enemy  he may have made independent contact with the
macrobes  he may be a potential ally ”

“did you think he looked like it  his priesthood is against him ”

“all that we now want ” said wither  “is a collar and tie  forgive me
for saying that i have never been able to share your root and branch
attitude to religion  i am not speaking of dogmatic christianity in its
primitive form  but within religious circles—ecclesiastical
circles—types of spirituality of very real value do from time to time
arise  when they do they sometimes reveal great energy  father doyle 
though not very talented  is one of our soundest colleagues  and mr 
straik has in him the germs of that total allegiance   objectivity  is 
i believe  the term you prefer  which is so rare  it doesnt do to be in
any way narrow ”

“what do you actually propose to do ”

“we will  of course  consult the head at once  i use that term  you
understand  purely for convenience ”

“but how can you  have you forgotten that this is the night of the
inaugural banquet  and that jules is coming down  he may be here in an
hour  you will be dancing attendance on him till midnight ”

for a moment withers face remained still  the mouth wide open  he had
indeed forgotten that the puppet director  the dupe of the institute by
whom it duped the public  was coming that night  but the realisation
that he had forgotten troubled him more than it would have troubled
another  it was like the first cold breath of winter—the first little
hint of a crack in that great secondary self or mental machine which he
had built up to carry on the business of living while he  the real
wither  floated far away on the indeterminate frontiers of ghosthood 

“god bless my soul ” he said 

“you have therefore to consider at once ” said frost  “what to do with
these two men this very evening  it is out of the question that they
should attend the banquet  it would be madness to leave them to their
own devices ”

“which reminds me that we have already left them alone—and with
studdock  too—for over ten minutes  we must go back with the clothes at
once ”

“and without a plan ” enquired frost  though following wither out of the
room as he said it 

“we must be guided by circumstances ” said wither 

they were greeted on their return by a babble of imploring latin from
the man in the cassock  “let me go ” he said  “i entreat you do not  for
your mothers sakes  do violence to a poor harmless old man  i will tell
nothing—god forgive me—but i cannot stay here  this man who says he is
merlinus come back from the dead—he is a diabolist  a worker of infernal
miracles  look  look what he did to the poor young man the moment you
had left the room ” he pointed to where mark lay unconscious in his
chair  “he did it with his eye  only by looking at him  the evil eye 
the evil eye ”

“silence ” said frost in the same language  “and listen  if you do what
you are told  no harm will come to you  if you do not  you will be
destroyed  i think that if you are troublesome you may lose your soul as
well as your life  for you do not sound likely to be a martyr ”

the man whimpered  covering his face with his hands  suddenly  not as if
he wished to but as if he were a machine that had been worked  frost
kicked him  “get on ” he said  “tell him we have brought such clothes as
men wear now ” the man did not stagger when he was kicked 

the end of it was that the tramp was washed and dressed  when this had
been done  the man in the cassock said  “he is saying that he must now
be taken for a journey through all your house and shown the secrets ”

“tell him ” said wither  “that it will be a very great pleasure and
privilege——”

but here the tramp spoke again  “he says ” translated the big man 
“first that he must see the head and the beasts and the criminals who
are being tormented  secondly  that he will go with one of you alone 
with you  sir ” and here he turned to wither 

“i will allow no such arrangement ” said frost in english 

“my dear frost ” said wither  “this is hardly the moment       and  one 
of us must be free to meet jules ”

the tramp had spoken again  “forgive me ” said the man in the cassock 
“i must follow what he says  the words are not mine  he forbids you to
talk in his presence in a tongue which he cannot  even through me 
understand  and he says it is an old habit of his to be obeyed  he is
asking now whether you wish to have him for a friend or an enemy ”

frost took a pace nearer to the pseudo-merlin so that his shoulder
touched the rusty cassock of the real one  wither thought that frost had
intended to say something but had grown afraid  in reality  frost found
it impossible to remember any words  perhaps it was due to the rapid
shifts from latin to english which had been going on  he could not
speak  nothing but nonsense syllables would occur to his mind  he had
long known that his continued intercourse with the beings he called
macrobes might have effects on his psychology which he could not
predict  in a dim sort of way the possibility of complete destruction
was never out of his thoughts  he had schooled himself not to attend to
it  now  it seemed to be descending on him  he reminded himself that
fear was only a chemical phenomenon  for the moment  clearly  he must
step out of the struggle  come to himself  and make a new start later in
the evening  for  of course  this could not be final  at the very worst
it could only be the first hint of the end  probably he had years of
work before him  he would outlast wither  he would kill the priest  even
merlin  if it was merlin  might not stand better with the macrobes than
himself  he stood aside  and the tramp  accompanied by the real merlin
and the deputy director  left the room 

frost had been right in thinking that the aphasia would be only
temporary  as soon as they were alone he found no difficulty in saying 
as he shook mark by the shoulder  “get up  what do you mean by sleeping
here  come with me to the objective room ”


                                   iv

before proceeding to their tour of inspection merlin demanded robes for
the tramp  and wither finally dressed him as a doctor of philosophy of
the university of edgestow  thus arrayed  walking with his eyes half
shut  and as delicately as if he were treading on eggs  the bewildered
tinker was led upstairs and downstairs and through the zoo and into the
cells  every now and then his face underwent a kind of spasm as if he
were trying to say something  but he never succeeded in producing any
words except when the real merlin asked him a question and fixed him
with his eye  of course  all this was not to the tramp what it would
have been to anyone who made an educated and wealthy mans demands upon
the universe  it was  no doubt  a “rum do”—the rummest do that had ever
befallen him  the mere sensation of being clean all over would have made
it that  even apart from the crimson robe and the fact that his own
mouth kept on uttering sounds he did not understand and without his own
consent  but it was not by any means the first inexplicable thing that
had been done to him 

meanwhile  in the objective room  something like a crisis had developed
between mark and professor frost  as soon as they arrived there mark saw
that the table had been drawn back  on the floor lay a large crucifix 
almost life-size  a work of art in the spanish tradition  ghastly and
realistic  “we have half an hour to pursue our exercises ” said frost 
looking at his watch  then he instructed mark to trample on it and
insult it in other ways 

now  whereas jane had abandoned christianity in early childhood  along
with her belief in fairies and santa claus  mark had never believed in
it at all  at this moment  therefore  it crossed his mind for the very
first time that there might conceivably be something in it  frost  who
was watching him carefully  knew perfectly well that this might be the
result of the present experiment  he knew it for the very good reason
that his own training by the macrobes had  at one point  suggested the
same odd idea to himself  but he had no choice  whether he wished it or
not  this sort of thing was part of the initiation 

“but  look here ” said mark 

“what is it ” said frost  “pray be quick  we have only a limited time at
our disposal ”

“this ” said mark  pointing with an undefined reluctance to the horrible
white figure on the cross  “this is all surely a pure superstition ”

“well ”

“well  if so  what is their objective about stamping on the face  isnt
it just as subjective to spit on a thing like this as to worship it  i
mean—damn it all—if its only a bit of wood  why do anything about it ”

“that is superficial  if you had been brought up in a non-christian
society  you would not be asked to do this  of course it is a
superstition  but it is that particular superstition which has pressed
upon our society for a great many centuries  it can be experimentally
shown that it still forms a dominant system in the subconscious of many
individuals whose conscious thought appears to be wholly liberated  an
explicit action in the reverse direction is therefore a necessary step
towards complete objectivity  it is not a question for  a priori 
discussion  we find in practice that it cannot be dispensed with ”

mark himself was surprised at the emotions he was undergoing  he did not
regard the image with anything at all like a religious feeling  most
emphatically it did not belong to that idea of the straight or normal or
wholesome which had  for the last few days  been his support against
what he now knew of the innermost circle at belbury  the horrible vigour
of its realism was  indeed  in its own way as remote from that idea as
anything else in the room  that was one source of his reluctance  to
insult even a carved image of such agony seemed an abominable act  but
it was not the only source  with the introduction of this christian
symbol the whole situation had somehow altered  the thing was becoming
incalculable  his simple antithesis of the normal and the diseased had
obviously failed to take something into account  why was the crucifix
there  why were more than half the poison-pictures religious  he had the
sense of new parties to the conflict—potential allies and enemies which
he had not suspected before  “if i take a step in any direction ” he
thought  “i may step over a precipice ” a donkey-like determination to
plant hoofs and stay still at all costs arose in his mind 

“pray make haste ” said frost 

the quiet urgency of the voice and the fact that he had so often obeyed
it before  almost conquered him  he was on the verge of obeying and
getting the whole silly business over  when the defencelessness of the
figure deterred him  the feeling was a very illogical one  not because
its hands were nailed and helpless  but because they were only made of
wood and therefore even more helpless  because the thing  for all its
realism  was inanimate and could not in any way hit back  he paused  the
unretaliating face of a doll—one of myrtles dolls—which he had pulled
to pieces in boyhood had affected him in the same way  and the memory 
even now  was tender to the touch 

“what are you waiting for  mr  studdock ” said frost 

mark was well aware of the rising danger  obviously  if he disobeyed 
his last chance of getting out of belbury alive might be gone  even of
getting out of this room  the smothering sensation once again attacked
him  he was himself  he felt  as helpless as the wooden christ  as he
thought this  he found himself looking at the crucifix in a new
way—neither as a piece of wood nor a monument of superstition but as a
bit of history  christianity was nonsense  but one did not doubt that
the man had lived and had been executed thus by the belbury of those
days  and that  as he suddenly saw  explained why this image  though not
itself an image of the straight or normal  was yet in opposition to
crooked belbury  it was a picture of what happened when the straight met
the crooked  a picture of what the crooked did to the straight—what it
would do to him if he remained straight  it was  in a more emphatic
sense than he had yet understood  a  cross  

“do you intend to go on with the training or not ” said frost  his eye
was on the time  he knew that those others were conducting their tour of
inspection and that jules must have very nearly reached belbury  he knew
that he might be interrupted at any moment  he had chosen this time for
this stage in marks initiation partly in obedience to an unexplained
impulse  such impulses grew more frequent with him every day   but
partly because he wished  in the uncertain situation which had now
arisen  to secure mark at once  he and wither and possibly  by now 
straik were the only full initiates in the n i c e  on them lay the
danger of making any false step in dealing with the man who claimed to
be merlin and with his mysterious interpreter  for him who took the
right steps there was a chance of ousting all the others  of becoming to
them what they were to the rest of the institute and what the institute
was to the rest of england  he knew that wither was waiting eagerly for
any slip on his own part  hence it seemed to him of the utmost
importance to bring mark as soon as possible beyond that point after
which there is no return  and the disciples allegiance both to the
macrobes and to the teacher who has initiated him becomes a matter of
psychological  or even physical  necessity 

“do you not hear what i am saying ” he asked mark again 

mark made no reply  he was thinking  and thinking hard because he knew
that if he stopped even for a moment mere terror of death would take the
decision out of his hands  christianity was a fable  it would be
ridiculous to die for a religion one did not believe  this man himself 
on that very cross  had discovered it to be a fable  and had died
complaining that the god in whom he trusted had forsaken him—had  in
fact  found the universe a cheat  but this raised a question that mark
had never thought of before  was  that  the moment at which to turn
against the man  if the universe was a cheat  was that a good reason for
joining its side  supposing the straight was utterly powerless  always
and everywhere certain to be mocked  tortured  and finally killed by the
crooked  what then  why not go down with the ship  he began to be
frightened by the very fact that his fears seemed to have momentarily
vanished  they had been a safeguard       they had prevented him  all
his life  from making mad decisions like that which he was now making as
he turned to frost and said  “its all bloody nonsense  and im damned
if i do any such thing ”

when he said this he had no idea what might happen next  he did not know
whether frost would ring a bell or produce a revolver or renew his
demands  in fact  frost simply went on staring at him and he stared
back  then he saw that frost was listening  and he began to listen
himself  a moment later the door opened  the room seemed suddenly to be
full of people—a man in a red gown  mark did not instantly recognise the
tramp  and the huge man in the black gown and wither 


                                   v

in the great drawing-room at belbury a singularly uncomfortable party
was by now assembled  horace jules  director of the n i c e   had
arrived about half an hour before  they had shown him to the deputy
directors study  but the deputy director was not there  then they had
shown him to his own rooms and hoped he would take a long time settling
in  he took a very short time  in five minutes he was downstairs again
and on their hands  and it was still much too early for anyone to go and
dress  he was now standing with his back to the fire drinking a glass of
sherry and the principal members of the institute were standing round
him  conversation was hanging fire 

conversation with mr  jules was always difficult  because he insisted on
regarding himself not as a figure-head but as the real director of the
institute  and even as the source of most of its ideas  and since  in
fact  any science he knew was that taught him at the university of
london over fifty years ago  and anything else he knew had been acquired
from writers like haeckel and joseph mccabe and winwood reade  it was
not  in fact  possible to talk to him about most of the things the
institute was really doing  one was always engaged in inventing answers
to questions which were actually meaningless and expressing enthusiasm
for ideas which were out of date and had been crude even in their prime 
that was why the absence of the deputy director in such interviews was
so disastrous  for wither alone was master of a conversational style
that exactly suited jules 

jules was a cockney  he was a very little man  whose legs were so short
that he had unkindly been compared to a duck  he had a turned-up nose
and a face in which some original  bonhomie  had been much interfered
with by years of good living and conceit  his novels had first raised
him to fame and affluence  later  as editor of the weekly called  we
want to know  he had become such a power in the country that his name
was really necessary to the n i c e 

“and as i said to the archbishop ” observed jules  “you may not know  my
lord  said i  that modern research shows the temple at jerusalem to have
been about the size of an english village church ”

“god ” said feverstone to himself  where he stood silent on the fringes
of the group 

“have a little more sherry  director ” said miss hardcastle 

“well  i dont mind if i do ” said jules  “its not at all bad sherry 
though i think i could tell you of a place where we could get something
better  and how are you getting on  miss hardcastle  with your reforms
of our penal system ”

“making real headway ” she replied  “i think some modification of the
pellotoff method——”

“what i always say ” remarked jules  interrupting her  “is  why not
treat crime like any other disease  ive no use for punishment  what you
want to do is to put the man on the right lines—give him a fresh
start—give him an interest in life  its all perfectly simple if you
look at it from that point of view  i dare say youve been reading a
little address on the subject i gave at northampton ”

“i agreed with you ” said miss hardcastle 

“thats right ” said jules  “i tell you who didnt  though  old
hingest—and by the by  that was a queer business  you never caught the
murderer  did you  but though im sorry for the old chap  i never did
quite see eye to eye with him  very last time i met him one or two of us
were talking about juvenile offenders  and do you know what he said  he
said  the trouble with these courts for young criminals nowadays is
that theyre always binding them over when they ought to be bending them
over  not bad  was it  still  as wither said—and  by the way  where
 is  wither ”

“i think he should be here any moment now ” said miss hardcastle  “i
cant imagine why hes not ”

“i think ” said filostrato  “he have a breakdown with his car  he will
be very desolated  mr  director  not to have given you the welcome ”

“oh  he neednt bother about that ” said jules  “i never was one for any
formality  though i did think hed be here when i arrived  youre
looking very well  filostrato  im following your work with great
interest  i look upon you as one of the makers of mankind ”

“yes  yes ” said filostrato  “that is the real business  already we
begin——”

“i try to help you all i can on the non-technical side ” said jules 
“its a battle ive been fighting for years  the whole question of our
sex-life  what i always say is that once you get the whole thing out
into the open  you dont have any more trouble  its all this victorian
secrecy which does the harm  making a mystery of it  i want every boy
and girl in the country——”

“god ” said feverstone to himself 

“forgive me ” said filostrato  who  being a foreigner  had not yet
despaired of trying to enlighten jules  “but that is not precisely the
point ”

“now  i know what youre going to say ” interrupted jules  laying a fat
forefinger on the professors sleeve  “and i dare say you dont read my
little paper  but  believe me  if you looked up the first number of last
month youd find a modest little editorial which a chap like you might
overlook because it doesnt use any technical terms  but i ask you just
to read it and see if it doesnt put the whole thing in a nutshell and
in a way that the man in the street can understand ”

at this moment the clock struck a quarter 

“i say ” asked jules  “what time is this dinner at ” he liked banquets 
and specially banquets at which he had to speak 

“at quarter to eight ” said miss hardcastle 

“you know ” said jules  “this fellow wither really ought to be here  i
mean to say  im not particular  but i dont mind telling you  between
you and me  that im a bit hurt  it isnt the kind of thing a chap
expects  is it ”

“i hope nothings gone wrong with him ” said miss hardcastle 

“youd hardly have thought hed have gone out anywhere  not on a day
like this ” said jules 

“ ecco  ” said filostrato  “someone come ”

it was indeed wither who entered the room  followed by a company whom
jules had not expected to see  and withers face had certainly good
reason to look even more chaotic than usual  he had been bustled round
his own institute as if he were a kind of footman  he had not even been
allowed to have the supply of air turned on for the head when they made
him take them into the heads room  and “merlin”  if it was merlin  had
ignored it  worst of all  it had gradually become clear to him that this
intolerable incubus and his interpreter fully intended to be present at
dinner  no one could be more keenly aware than wither of the absurdity
of introducing to jules a shabby old priest who couldnt speak english 
in charge of what looked like a somnambulist chimpanzee dressed up as a
doctor of philosophy  to tell jules the real explanation—even if he knew
which was the real explanation—was out of the question  for jules was a
simple man to whom the word “medieval” meant only “savage” and in whom
the word “magic” roused memories of  the golden bough   it was a minor
nuisance that ever since their visit to the objective room he had been
compelled to have both frost and studdock in attendance  nor did it mend
matters that as they approached jules  and all eyes were fixed upon
them  the pseudo-merlin collapsed into a chair  muttering  and closed
his eyes 

“my dear director ” began wither  a little out of breath  “this is one
of the happiest moments of my life  i hope your comfort has been in
every way attended to  it has been most unfortunate that i was called
away at the very moment when i was expecting your arrival  a remarkable
coincidence       another very distinguished person has joined us at the
very same moment  a foreigner      ”

“oh ” interrupted jules in a slightly rasping voice  “whos he ”

“allow me ” said wither  stepping a little to one side 

“do you mean  that  ” said jules  the supposed merlin sat with his arms
hanging down on each side of the chair  his eyes closed  his head on one
side  and a weak smile on his face  “is he drunk  or ill  and who is he 
anyway ”

“he is  as i was observing  a foreigner ” began wither 

“well  that doesnt make him go to sleep the moment he is introduced to
me  does it ”

“hush ” said wither  drawing jules a little out of the group and
lowering his voice  “there are circumstances—it would be very difficult
to go into it here—i have been taken by surprise and would  if you had
not been here already  have consulted you at the first possible moment 
our distinguished guest has just undertaken a very long journey and has 
i admit  certain eccentricities  and      ”

“but who is he ” persisted jules 

“his name is       er       ambrosius  dr  ambrosius  you know ”

“never eard of him ” snapped jules  at another time he might not have
made this admission  but the whole evening was turning out differently
from his expectations and he was losing his temper 

“very few of us have heard of him  yet  ” said wither  “but everyone
will have heard of him soon  that is why  without in the least      ”

“and whos  that  ” asked jules  indicating the real merlin  “he looks
as if he were enjoying himself ”

“oh  that is merely dr  ambrosiuss interpreter ”

“interpreter  cant he talk english ”

“unfortunately not  he lives rather in a world of his own ”

“and cant you get anyone except a priest to act for him  i dont like
the look of that fellow  we dont want that sort of thing here at all 
hullo  and who are  you  ”

the last question was addressed to straik  who had at this moment thrust
his way up to the director  “mr  jules ” he said  fixing the latter with
a prophetic eye  “i am the bearer of a message to you which you must
hear  i——”

“shut up ” said frost to straik 

“really  mr  straik  really ” said wither  between them they shouldered
him aside 

“now look ere  mr  wither ” said jules  “i tell you straight im very
far from satisfied  heres  another  parson  i dont remember the name
of any such person coming before me  and it wouldnt have got past me if
it had done  see  you and ill have to have a very serious conversation 
it seems to me youve been making appointments behind my back and
turning the place into a kind of seminary  and thats a thing i wont
stand  nor will the british people ”

“i know  i know ” said wither  “i understand your feelings exactly  you
can rely on complete sympathy  i am eager and waiting to explain the
situation to you  in the meantime  perhaps  as dr  ambrosius seems
slightly overcome and the dressing-bell has just sounded       oh  i beg
your pardon  this  is  dr  ambrosius ”

the tramp  to whom the real magician had recently turned  was now risen
from his chair  and approaching  jules held out his hand sulkily  the
other  looking over juless shoulder and grinning in an inexplicable
fashion  seized it and shook it  as if absent-mindedly  some ten or
fifteen times  his breath  jules noticed  was strong and his grip horny 
he was not liking dr  ambrosius  and he disliked even more the massive
form of the interpreter towering over them both 




                                sixteen
                           banquet at belbury 


                                   i

it was with great pleasure that mark found himself once more dressing
for dinner and what seemed likely to be an excellent dinner  he got a
seat with filostrato on his right and a rather inconspicuous newcomer on
his left  even filostrato seemed human and friendly compared with the
two initiates  and to the newcomer his heart positively warmed  he
noticed with surprise that the tramp sat at the high table between jules
and wither  but did not often look in that direction  for the tramp 
catching his eye  had imprudently raised his glass and winked at him 
the strange priest stood patiently behind the tramps chair  for the
rest  nothing of importance happened until the kings health had been
drunk and jules rose to make his speech 

for the first few minutes anyone glancing down the long tables would
have seen what we always see on such occasions  there were the placid
faces of elderly  bons viveurs  whom food and wine had placed in a
contentment which no amount of speeches could violate  there were the
patient faces of responsible but serious diners who had long since
learned how to pursue their own thoughts while attending to the speech
just enough to respond wherever a laugh or a low rumble of serious
assent was obligatory  there was the usual fidgety expression on the
faces of young men unappreciative of port and hungry for tobacco  there
was bright over-elaborate attention on the powdered faces of women who
knew their duty to society  but if you have gone on looking down the
tables you would presently have seen a change  you would have seen face
after face look up and turn in the direction of the speaker  you would
have seen first curiosity  then fixed attention  then incredulity 
finally  you would have noticed that the room was utterly silent 
without a cough or a creak  that every eye was fixed on jules  and soon
every mouth opened in something between fascination and horror 

to different members of the audience the change came differently  to
frost it began at the moment when he heard jules end a sentence with the
words “as gross an anachronism as to trust to calvary for salvation in
modern war ”  cavalry  thought frost almost aloud  why couldnt the fool
mind what he was saying  the blunder irritated him extremely 
perhaps—but hullo  what was this  had his hearing gone wrong  for jules
seemed to be saying that the future density of mankind depended on the
implosion of the horses of nature  “hes drunk ” thought frost  then 
crystal clear in articulation  beyond all possibility of mistake  came
“the madrigore of verjuice must be talthibianised ”

wither was slower to notice what was happening  he had never expected
the speech to have any meaning as a whole and for a long time the
familiar catchwords rolled on in a manner which did not disturb the
expectation of his ear  he thought  indeed  that jules was sailing very
near the wind  that a very small false step would deprive both the
speaker and the audience of even the power to pretend that he was saying
anything in particular  but as long as that border was not crossed  he
rather admired the speech  it was in his own line  then he thought 
“come  thats going too far  even they must see that you cant talk
about accepting the challenge of the past by throwing down the gauntlet
of the future ” he looked cautiously down the room  all was well  but it
wouldnt be if jules didnt sit down pretty soon  in that last sentence
there were surely words he didnt know  what the deuce did he mean by
 aholibate   he looked down the room again  they were attending too
much  always a bad sign  then came the sentence  “the surrogates
esemplanted in a continual of porous variations ”

mark did not at first attend to the speech at all  he had plenty of
other things to think of  the appearance of this spouting popinjay at
the very crisis of his own history was a mere interruption  he was too
endangered and yet also  in some precarious way  too happy to bother
about jules  once or twice some phrase caught his ear and made him want
to smile  what first awoke him to the real situation was the behaviour
of those who sat near him  he was aware of their increasing stillness 
he noticed that everyone except himself had begun to attend  he looked
up and saw their faces  and then first he really listened  “we shall
not ” jules was saying  “we shall not till we can secure the erebation
of all prostundiary initems ” little as he cared for jules  a sudden
shock of alarm pierced him  he looked round again  obviously it was not
he who was mad—they had all heard the gibberish  except possibly the
tramp  who looked as solemn as a judge  he had never heard a speech from
one of these real toffs before and would have been disappointed if he
could understand it  nor had he ever before drunk vintage port  and
though he did not much like the taste  he had been working away like a
man 

wither had not forgotten for a moment that there were reporters present 
that in itself did not matter much  if anything unsuitable appeared in
to-morrows paper  it would be childs play for him to say that the
reporters were drunk or mad and break them  on the other hand  he might
let the story pass  jules was in many respects a nuisance  and this
might be as good an opportunity as any other for ending his career  but
this was not the immediate question  wither was wondering whether he
should wait till jules sat down or whether he should rise and interrupt
him with a few judicious words  he did not want a scene  it would be
better if jules sat down of his own accord  at the same time there was
by now an atmosphere in that crowded room which warned wither not to
delay too long  glancing down at the second hand of his watch  he
decided to wait two minutes more  almost as he did so he knew that he
had misjudged it  an intolerable falsetto laugh rang out from the bottom
of the table and would not stop  some fool of a woman had got hysterics 
immediately wither touched jules on the arm  signed to him with a nod 
and rose 

“eh  blotcher bulldoo ” muttered jules  but wither  laying his hand on
the little mans shoulder  quietly but with all his weight  forced him
down into a sitting position  then wither cleared his throat  he knew
how to do that so that every eye in the room turned immediately to look
at him  the woman stopped screaming  people who had been sitting dead
still in strained positions moved and relaxed  wither looked down the
room for a second or two in silence  feeling his grip on the audience 
he saw that he already had them in hand  there would be no more
hysterics  then he began to speak 

they ought to have all looked more and more comfortable as he proceeded 
and there ought soon to have been murmurs of grave regret for the
tragedy which they had just witnessed  that was what wither expected 
what he actually saw bewildered him  the same too attentive silence
which had prevailed during juless speech had returned  bright
unblinking eyes and open mouths greeted him in every direction  the
woman began to laugh again—or no  this time it was two women  cosser 
after one frightened glance  jumped up  overturning his chair  and
bolted from the room 

the deputy director could not understand this  for to him his own voice
seemed to be uttering the speech he had resolved to make  but the
audience heard him saying  “tidies and fugleman—i sheel foor that we
all—er—most steeply rebut the defensible  though  i trust  lavatory 
aspasia which gleams to have selected our redeemed inspector this
deceiving  it would—ah—be shark  very shark  from anyones debenture      ”

the woman who had laughed rose hastily from her chair  the man seated
next to her heard her murmur in his ear  “vood wooloo ” he took in the
meaningless syllables and her unnatural expression at one moment  both
for some reason infuriated him  he rose to help her to move back her
chair with one of those gestures of savage politeness which often  in
modern society  serve instead of blows  he wrenched the chair  in fact 
out of her hand  she screamed  tripped on a ruck in the carpet and fell 
the man on the other side of her saw her fall and saw the first mans
expression of fury  “bot are you blammit ” he roared  leaning towards
him with a threatening movement  four or five people in that part of the
room were now up  they were shouting  at the same time there was
movement elsewhere  several of the younger men were making for the door 
“bundlemen  bundlemen ” said wither sternly  in a much louder voice  he
had often before  merely by raising his voice and speaking one
authoritative word  reduced troublesome meetings to order 

but this time he was not even heard  at least twenty people present were
at that very moment attempting to do the same thing  to each of them it
seemed plain that things were just at that stage when a word or so of
plain sense  spoken in a new voice  would restore the whole room to
sanity  one thought of a sharp word  one of a joke  one of something
very quiet and telling  as a result fresh gibberish in a great variety
of tones rang out from several places at once  frost was the only one of
the leaders who attempted to say nothing  instead  he had pencilled a
few words on a slip of paper  beckoned to a servant  and made him
understand by signs that it was to be given to miss hardcastle 

by the time the message was put into her hands the clamour was
universal  to mark it sounded like the noise of a crowded restaurant in
a foreign country  miss hardcastle smoothed out the paper and stooped
her head to read  the message ran   blunt frippers intantly to pointed
bdeluroid  purgent  cost   she crumpled it up in her hand 

miss hardcastle had known before she got the message that she was three
parts drunk  she had expected and intended to be so  she knew that later
on in the evening she would go down to the cells and do things  there
was a new prisoner there—a little fluffy girl of the kind the fairy
enjoyed—with whom she could pass an agreeable hour  the tumult of
gibberish did not alarm her  she found it exciting  apparently frost
wanted her to take some action  she decided that she would  she rose and
walked the whole length of the room to the door  locked it  put the key
in her pocket  and then turned to survey the company  she noticed for
the first time that neither the supposed merlin nor the basque priest
were anywhere to be seen  wither and jules  both on their feet  were
struggling with each other  she set out towards them 

so many people had now risen that it took her a long time to reach them 
all semblance of a dinner-party had disappeared  it was more like the
scene at a london terminus on a bank holiday  everyone was trying to
restore order  but everyone was unintelligible  and everyone  in the
effort to be understood  was talking louder and louder  she shouted
several times herself  she even fought a good deal before she reached
her goal 

there came an ear-splitting noise and after that  at last  a few seconds
of dead silence  mark noticed first that jules had been killed  only
secondly that miss hardcastle had shot him  after that it was difficult
to be sure what happened  the stampede and the shouting may have
concealed a dozen reasonable plans for disarming the murderess  but it
was impossible to concert them  nothing came of them but kicking 
struggling  leaping on tables and under tables  pressing on and pulling
back  screams  breaking of glass  she fired again and again  it was the
smell more than anything else which recalled the scene to mark in later
life  the smell of the shooting mixed with the sticky compound smell of
blood and port and madeira 

suddenly the confusion of cries ran all together into one thin
long-drawn noise of terror  everyone had become  more  frightened 
something had darted very quickly across the floor between the two long
tables and disappeared under one of them  perhaps half the people
present had not seen what it was—had only caught a gleam of black and
tawny  those who had seen it clearly could not tell the others  they
could only point and scream meaningless syllables  but mark had
recognised it  it was a tiger 

for the first time that evening everybody realised how many
hiding-places the room contained  the tiger might be under any of the
tables  it might be in any of the deep bay windows  behind the curtains 
there was a screen across one corner of the room  too 

it is not to be supposed that even now none of the company kept their
heads  with loud appeals to the whole room or with urgent whispers to
their immediate neighbours they tried to stem the panic  to arrange an
orderly retreat from the room  to indicate how the brute could be lured
or scared into the open and shot  but the doom of gibberish frustrated
all their efforts  they could not arrest the two movements which were
going on  the majority had not seen miss hardcastle lock the door  they
were pressing towards it  to get out at all costs  they would fight 
they would kill if they could  rather than not reach the door  a large
majority  on the other hand  knew that the door was locked  there must
be another door  the one used by the servants  the one whereby the tiger
had got in  they were pressing to the opposite end of the room to find
it  the whole centre of the room was occupied by the meeting of these
two waves—a huge football scrum  at first noisy with frantic efforts at
explanation  but soon  as the struggle thickened  almost silent except
for the sound of labouring breath  kicking or trampling feet  and
meaningless muttering 

four or five of these combatants lurched heavily against a table 
pulling off the cloth in their fall and with it all the fruit-dishes 
decanters  glasses  plates  out of that confusion with a howl of terror
broke the tiger  it happened so quickly that mark hardly took it in  he
saw the hideous head  the cats snarl of the mouth  the flaming eyes  he
heard a shot—the last  then the tiger had disappeared again  something
fat and white and bloodied was down among the feet of the scrummers 
mark could not recognise it at first  for the face  from where he stood 
was upside down  and the grimaces disguised it until it was quite dead 
then he recognised miss hardcastle 

wither and frost were no longer to be seen  there was a growling close
at hand  mark turned  thinking he had located the tiger  then he caught
out of the corner of his eye a glimpse of something smaller and greyer 
he thought it was an alsatian  if so  the dog was mad  it ran along the
table  its tail between its legs  slavering  a woman  standing with her
back to the table  turned  saw it  tried to scream  next moment went
down as the creature leaped at her throat  it was a wolf  “ai—ai  ”
squealed filostrato  and jumped on the table  something else had darted
between his feet  mark saw it streak across the floor and enter the
scrum and wake that mass of interlocked terror into new and frantic
convulsions  it was some kind of snake 

above the chaos of sounds which now awoke—there seemed to be a new
animal in the room every minute—there came at last one sound in which
those still capable of understanding could take comfort 
 thud—thud—thud   the door was being battered from the outside  it was a
huge folding door  a door by which a small locomotive could almost
enter  for the room was made in imitation of versailles  already one or
two of the panels were splintering  the noise maddened those who had
made that door their goal  it seemed also to madden the animals  they
did not stop to eat what they killed  or not more than to take one lick
of the blood  there were dead and dying bodies everywhere by now  for
the scrum was by this time killing as many as the beasts  and always
from all sides went up the voices trying to shout to those beyond the
door  “quick  quick  hurry ” but shouting only nonsense  louder and
louder grew the noise at the door  as if in imitation a great gorilla
leaped on the table where jules had sat and began drumming on its chest 
then  with a roar  it jumped down into the crowd 

at last the door gave  both wings gave  the passage  framed in the
doorway  was dark  out of the darkness there came a grey snaky
something  it swayed in the air  then began methodically to break off
the splintered wood on each side and make the doorway clear  then mark
saw distinctly how it swooped down  curled itself round a man—steele  he
thought  but everyone looked different now—and lifted him bodily high
off the floor  after that  monstrous  improbable  the huge shape of the
elephant thrust its way into the room  its eyes enigmatic  its ears
standing stiffly out like devils wings on each side of its head  it
stood for a second with steele writhing in the curl of its trunk and
then dashed him to the floor  it trampled him  after that it raised head
and trunk again and brayed horribly  then plunged straight forward into
the room  trumpeting and trampling—continuously trampling like a girl
treading grapes  heavily and soon wetly trampling in a pash of blood and
bones  of flesh  wine  fruit  and sodden table-cloth  something more
than danger darted from the sight into marks brain  the pride and
insolent glory of the beast  the carelessness of its killings  seemed to
crush his spirit even as its flat feet were crushing women and men 
here  surely  came the king of the world       then everything went
black and he knew no more 


                                   ii

when mr  bultitude had come to his senses he had found himself in a dark
place full of unfamiliar smells  this did not very greatly surprise or
trouble him  he was inured to mystery  to poke his head into any spare
bedroom at st  annes  as he sometimes managed to do  was an adventure
no less remarkable than that which had now befallen him  and the smells
here were  on the whole  promising  he perceived that food was in the
neighbourhood and—more exciting still—a female of his own species  there
were a great many other animals about too  apparently  but that was
rather irrelevant than alarming  he decided to go and find both the
female bear and the food  it was then he discovered that walls met him
in three directions and bars in the fourth  he could not get out  this 
combined with an inarticulate want for the human companionship to which
he was accustomed  gradually plunged him into depression  sorrow such as
only animals know—huge seas of disconsolate emotion with not one little
raft of reason to float on—drowned him fathoms deep  in his own fashion
he lifted up his voice and wept 

and yet  not very far away from him  another  and human  captive was
almost equally engulfed  mr  maggs  seated in a little white cell 
chewed steadily on his great sorrow as only a simple man can chew  an
educated man in his circumstances would have found misery streaked with
reflection  would have been thinking how this new idea of cure instead
of punishment  so humane in seeming  had in fact deprived the criminal
of all rights and by taking away the  name  punishment made the  thing 
infinite  but mr  maggs thought all the time simply of one thing  that
this was the day he had counted on all through his sentence  that he had
expected by this time to be having his tea at home with ivy  shed have
got something tasty for him the first night  and that it hadnt
happened  he sat quite still  about once in every two minutes a single
large tear trickled down his cheek  he wouldnt have minded so much if
theyd let him have a packet of fags 

it was merlin who brought release to both  he had left the dining-room
as soon as the curse of babel was well fixed upon the enemies  no one
had seen him go  wither had once heard his voice calling loud and
intolerably glad above the riot of nonsense  “ qui verbum dei
contempserunt  eis auferetur etiam verbum hominis ”  “they that have
despised the word of god  from them shall the word of man also be taken
away”   after that he did not see him again  nor the tramp either 
merlin had gone and spoiled his house  he had liberated beasts and men 
the animals that were already maimed he killed with an instantaneous
motion of the powers that were in him  swift and painless as the mild
shafts of artemis  to mr  maggs he had handed a written message  it ran
as follows 

  “dearest tom —i do hope your well and the director here is one of the
  right sort and he says to come as quick as you can to the manor at st 
  annes  and dont go through edgestow tom whatever you do but come any
  way you can i should think someone had give you a lift  everything is
  all-right no more now  lots of love ever your own ivy ”

the other prisoners he let go where they pleased  the tramp  finding
merlins back turned on him for a second  and having noticed that the
house seemed to be empty  made his escape  first into the kitchen and
thence  reinforced with all the edibles his pockets would hold  into the
wide world  i have not been able to trace him further 

the beasts  except for one donkey who disappeared about the same time as
the tramp  merlin sent to the dining-room  maddened with his voice and
touch  but he retained mr  bultitude  the latter had recognised him at
once as the same man whom he had sat beside in the blue room  less sweet
and sticky than on that occasion  but recognisably the same  even
without the brilliantine there was that in merlin which exactly suited
the bear and at their meeting it “made him all the cheer that a beast
can make a man ” he laid his hand on its head and whispered in its ear 
and its dark mind was filled with excitement as though some long
forbidden and forgotten pleasure were suddenly held out to it  down the
long  empty passages of belbury it padded behind them  saliva dripped
from its mouth and it was beginning to growl  it was thinking of warm 
salt tastes  of the pleasant resistances of bone  of things to crunch
and lick and worry 


                                  iii

mark felt himself shaken  then the cold shock of water dashed in his
face  with difficulty he sat up  the room was empty except for the
bodies of the distorted dead  the unmoved electric light glared down on
hideous confusion—food and filth  spoiled luxury and mangled men  each
more hideous by reason of the other  it was the supposed basque priest
who had roused him   surge  miselle   “get up  wretched boy”   he said 
helping mark to his feet  mark rose  he had some cuts and bruises and
his head ached  but he was substantially uninjured  the man held out to
him wine in one of the great silver cups  but mark turned away from it
with a shudder  he looked with bewilderment on the face of the stranger
and found that a letter was being put into his hand  “your wife awaits
you ” it ran  “at the manor at st  annes on the hill  come quickly by
road as best you can  do not go near edgestow —a  denniston ” he looked
again at merlin and thought his face terrible  but merlin met his glance
with a look of unsmiling authority  laid a hand on his shoulder  and
impelled him over all the tinkling and slippery havoc to the door  his
fingers sent a prickly sensation through marks skin  he was led down to
the cloakroom  made to fling on a coat and hat  neither were his own 
and thence out under the stars  bitter cold and two oclock in the
morning  sirius bitter green  a few flakes of dry snow beginning to
fall  he hesitated  the stranger stood back from him for a second  then 
with his open hand  struck him on the back  marks bones ached at the
memory as long as he lived  next moment he found himself running as he
had never run since boyhood  not in fear  but because his legs would not
stop  when he became master of them again he was half a mile from
belbury  and looking back he saw a light in the sky 


                                   iv

wither was not among those killed in the dining-room  he naturally knew
all the possible ways out of the room  and even before the coming of the
tiger he had slipped away  he understood what was happening  if not
perfectly  yet better than anyone else  he saw that the basque
interpreter had done the whole thing  and  by that  he knew also that
powers more than human had come down to destroy belbury  only one in the
saddle of whose soul rode mercury himself could thus have unmade
language  and this again told him something worse  it meant that his own
dark masters had been completely out in their calculations  they had
talked of a barrier which made it impossible that powers from deep
heaven should reach the surface of the earth  had assured him that
nothing from outside could pass the moons orbit  all their polity was
based on the belief that tellus was blockaded  beyond the reach of such
assistance and left  as far as that went  to their mercy and his 
therefore he knew that everything was lost 

it is incredible how little this knowledge moved him  it could not 
because he had long ceased to believe in knowledge itself  what had been
in his far-off youth a merely aesthetic repugnance to realities that
were crude or vulgar  had deepened and darkened  year after year  into a
fixed refusal of everything that was in any degree other than himself 
he had passed from hegel into hume  thence through pragmatism  and
thence through logical positivism  and out at last into the complete
void  the indicative mood now corresponded to no thought that his mind
could entertain  he had willed with his whole heart that there should be
no reality and no truth  and now even the imminence of his own ruin
could not wake him  the last scene of  dr  faustus  where the man raves
and implores on the edge of hell is  perhaps  stage fire  the last
moments before damnation are not often so dramatic  often the man knows
with perfect clarity that some still possible action of his own will
could yet save him  but he cannot make this knowledge real to himself 
some tiny habitual sensuality  some resentment too trivial to waste on a
blue-bottle  the indulgence of some fatal lethargy  seems to him at that
moment more important than the choice between total joy and total
destruction  with eyes wide open  seeing that the endless terror is just
about to begin and yet  for the moment  unable to feel terrified  he
watches passively  not moving a finger for his own rescue  while the
last links with joy and reason are severed  and drowsily sees the trap
close upon his soul  so full of sleep are they at the time when they
leave the right way 

straik and filostrato were also still alive  they met in one of the
cold  lighted passages  so far away from the dining-room that the noise
of the carnage was but a faint murmur  filostrato was hurt  his right
arm badly mauled  they did not speak—both knew that the attempt would be
useless—but walked on side by side  filostrato was intending to get
round to the garage by a back way  he thought that he might still be
able to drive  in a fashion  at least as far as sterk 

as they rounded a corner they both saw what they had often seen before
but had expected never to see again—the deputy director  stooped 
creaking  pacing  humming his tune  filostrato did not want to go with
him  but wither  as if noticing his wounded condition  offered him an
arm  filostrato tried to decline it  nonsense syllables came from his
mouth  wither took his left arm firmly  straik seized the other  the
mauled arm  squealing and shivering with pain  filostrato accompanied
them perforce  but worse awaited him  he was not an initiate  he knew
nothing of the dark eldils  he believed that his skill had really kept
alcasans brain alive  hence  even in his pain  he cried out with horror
when he found the other two drawing him through the ante-room of the
head and into the heads presence without pausing for any of those
antiseptic preparations which he had always imposed on his colleagues 
he tried vainly to tell them that one moment of such carelessness might
undo all his work  but this time it was in the room itself that his
conductors began undressing  and this time they took off all their
clothes 

they plucked off his  too  when the right sleeve  stiff with blood 
would not move  wither got a knife from the ante-room and ripped it  in
the end  the three men stood naked before the head—gaunt  big-boned
straik  filostrato a wobbling mountain of fat  wither an obscene
senility  then the high ridge of terror from which filostrato was never
again to descend  was reached  for what he thought impossible began to
happen  no one had read the dials  adjusted the pressures  or turned on
the air and the artificial saliva  yet words came out of the dry gaping
mouth of the dead mans head  “adore ” it said 

filostrato felt his companions forcing his body forwards  then up again 
then forwards and downwards a second time  he was compelled to bob up
and down in rhythmic obeisance  the others meanwhile doing the same 
almost the last thing he saw on earth was the skinny folds on withers
neck shaking like the wattles of a turkey-cock  almost the last thing he
heard was wither beginning to chant  then straik joined in  then 
horribly  he found he was singing himself—

  “ouroborindra 
  ouroborindra 
  ouroborindra ba-ba-hee ”

but not for long  “another ” said the voice  “give me another head ”
filostrato knew at once why they were forcing him to a certain place in
the wall  he had devised it all himself  in the wall that separated the
heads room from the ante-chamber there was a little shutter  when drawn
back it revealed a window in the wall  and a sash to that window which
could fall quickly and heavily  but the sash was a knife  the little
guillotine had not been meant to be used like this  they were going to
murder him uselessly  unscientifically  if he were doing it to one of
them  all would have been different  everything would have been prepared
weeks beforehand—the temperature of both rooms exactly right  the blade
sterilised  the attachments all ready to be made almost before the head
was severed  he had even calculated what changes the terror of the
victim would probably make in his blood-pressure  the artificial
blood-stream would be arranged accordingly  so as to take over its work
with the least possible breach of continuity  his last thought was that
he had underestimated the terror 

the two initiates  red from top to toe  gazed at each other  breathing
heavily  almost before the fat dead legs and buttocks of the italian had
ceased quivering  they were driven to begin the ritual again—

  “ouroborindra 
  ouroborindra 
  ouroborindra ba-ba-hee ”

the same thought struck both of them at one moment—“it will ask for
another ” and straik remembered that wither had that knife  he wrenched
himself free from the rhythm with a frightful effort  claws seemed to be
tearing his chest from inside  wither saw what he meant to do  as straik
bolted  wither was already after him  straik reached the ante-room 
slipped in filostratos blood  wither slashed repeatedly with his knife 
he had not strength to cut through the neck  but he had killed the man 
he stood up  pains gnawing at his old mans heart  then he saw the
italians head lying on the floor  it seemed to him good to pick it up
and carry it into the inner room  show it to the original head  he did
so  then he realised that something was moving in the ante-room  could
it be that they had not shut the outer door  he could not remember  they
had come in  forcing filostrato along between them  it was
possible       everything had been so abnormal  he put down his
burden—carefully  almost courteously  even now—and stepped towards the
door between the two rooms  next moment he drew back  a great bear 
rising to its hind legs as he came in sight of it  had met him in the
doorway—its mouth open  its eyes flaming  its forepaws spread out as if
for an embrace  was this what straik had become  he knew  though even
now he could not attend to it  that he was on the very frontier of a
world where such things could happen

no one at belbury that night had been cooler than feverstone  he was
neither an initiate like wither nor a dupe like filostrato  he knew
about the macrobes  but it wasnt the sort of thing he was interested
in  he knew that the belbury scheme might not work  but he knew that if
it didnt he would get out in time  he had a dozen lines of retreat kept
open  he had also a perfectly clear conscience and had played no tricks
with his mind  he had never slandered another man except to get his job 
never cheated except because he wanted money  never really disliked
people unless they bored him  he saw at a very early stage that
something was going wrong  one had to guess how far wrong  was this the
end of belbury  if so  he must get back to edgestow and work up the
position he had already prepared for himself as the protector of the
university against the n i c e  on the other hand  if there were any
chance of figuring as the man who had saved belbury at a moment of
crisis  that would be definitely the better line  he would wait as long
as it was safe  and he waited a long time  he found a hatch through
which hot dishes were passed from the kitchen passage into the
dining-room  he got through it and watched the scene  his nerves were
excellent  and he thought he could pull and bolt the shutter in time if
any dangerous animal made for the hatch  he stood there during the whole
massacre  his eyes bright  something like a smile on his face  smoking
endless cigarettes and drumming with his hard fingers on the sill of the
hatch  when it was all over he said to himself  “well  im damned ” it
had certainly been a most extraordinary show 

the beasts had all streaked away somewhere  he knew there was a chance
of meeting one or two of them in the passages  but hed have to risk
that  danger—in moderation—acted on him like a tonic  he worked his way
to the back of the house and into the garage  it looked as if he must go
to edgestow at once  he could not find his car in the garage—indeed 
there were far fewer cars than he had expected  apparently several other
people had had the idea of getting away while the going was good  and
his own car had been stolen  he felt no resentment  and set about
finding another of the same make  it took him a longish time  and when
he had found one he had considerable difficulty in starting her up  the
night was cold—going to snow  he thought  he scowled  for the first time
that night  he hated snow  it was after two oclock when he got going 

just before he started he had the odd impression that someone had got
into the back of the car behind him  “whos that ” he asked sharply  he
decided to get out and see  but to his surprise his body did not obey
this decision  instead it drove the car out of the garage and round to
the front and out into the road  the snow was definitely falling by now 
he found he could not turn his head and could not stop driving  he was
going ridiculously fast  too  in this damned snow  he had no choice 
hed often heard of cars being driven from the back seat  but now it
seemed to be really happening  then to his dismay he found he had left
the road  the car  still at a reckless speed  was bumping and leaping
along what was called gipsy lane or  by the educated  wayland street—the
old roman road from belbury to edgestow  all grass and ruts  “here  what
the devil am i doing ” thought feverstone  “am i tight  ill break my
neck at this game if i dont look out ” but on the car went as if driven
by one who regarded this track as an excellent road and the obvious
route to edgestow 


                                   vi

frost had left the dining-room a few minutes after wither  he did not
know where he was going or what he was about to do  for many years he
had theoretically believed that all which appears in the mind as motive
or intention is merely a by-product of what the body is doing  but for
the last year or so—since he had been initiated—he had begun to taste as
fact what he had long held as theory  increasingly  his actions had been
without motive  he did this and that  he said thus and thus  and did not
know why  his mind was a mere spectator  he could not understand why
that spectator should exist at all  he resented its existence  even
while assuring himself that resentment also was merely a chemical
phenomenon  the nearest thing to a human passion which still existed in
him was a sort of cold fury against all who believed in the mind  there
was no tolerating such an illusion  there were not  and must not be 
such things as men  but never  until this evening  had he been quite so
vividly aware that the body and its movements were the only reality 
that the self which seemed to watch the body leaving the dining-room and
setting out for the chamber of the head  was a nonentity  how
infuriating that the body should have power thus to project a phantom
self 

thus the frost whose existence frost denied watched his body go into the
ante-room  watched it pull up sharply at the sight of a naked and
bloodied corpse  the chemical reaction called shock  occurred  frost
stooped  turned the body over  and recognised straik  a moment later his
flashing pince-nez and pointed beard looked into the room of the head
itself  he hardly noticed that wither and filostrato lay there dead  his
attention was fixed by something more serious  the bracket where the
head ought to have been was empty  the metal ring twisted  the rubber
tubes tangled and broken  then he noticed a head on the floor  stooped
and examined it  it was filostratos  of alcasans head he found no
trace  unless some mess of broken bones beside filostratos were it 

still not asking what he would do  or why  frost went to the garage  the
whole place was silent and empty  the snow was thick on the ground by
this  he came up with as many petrol tins as he could carry  he piled
all the inflammables he could think of together in the objective room 
then he locked himself in by locking the outer door of the ante-room 
whatever it was that dictated his actions then compelled him to push the
key into the speaking-tube which communicated with the passage  when he
had pushed it as far in as his fingers could reach  he took a pencil
from his pocket and pushed with that  presently he heard the clink of
the key falling on the passage floor outside  that tiresome illusion 
his consciousness  was screaming in protest  his body  even had he
wished  had no power to attend to those screams  like the clockwork
figure he had chosen to be  his stiff body  now terribly cold  walked
back into the objective room  poured out the petrol and threw a lighted
match into the pile  not till then did his controllers allow him to
suspect that death itself might not after all cure the illusion of being
a soul—nay  might prove the entry into a world where that illusion raged
infinite and unchecked  escape for the soul  if not for the body  was
offered him  he became able to know  and simultaneously refused the
knowledge  that he had been wrong from the beginning  that souls and
personal responsibility existed  he half saw  he wholly hated  the
physical torture of the burning was hardly fiercer than his hatred of
that  with one supreme effort he flung himself back into his illusion 
in that attitude eternity overtook him as sunrise in old tales overtakes
trolls and turns them into unchangeable stone

daylight came with no visible sunrise as mark was climbing to the
highest ground in his journey  the white road  still virgin of human
traffic  showed the footprints of here and there a bird and here and
there a rabbit  for the snow-shower was just then coming to its end in a
flurry of larger and slower flakes  a big lorry  looking black and warm
in that landscape  overtook him  the man put out his head  “going
birmingham way  mate ” he asked 

“roughly ” said mark  “at least im going to st  annes ”

“wheres that  then ” said the driver 

“up on the hill behind pennington ” said mark 

“ah ” said the man  “i could take you to the corner  save you a bit ”

mark got in beside him 

it was mid-morning when the man dropped him at a corner beside a little
country hotel  the snow had all lain and there was more in the sky and
the day was extremely silent  mark went into the little hotel and found
a kind elderly landlady  he had a hot bath and a capital breakfast  and
then went to sleep in a chair before a roaring fire  he did not wake
till about four  he reckoned he was only a few miles from st  annes 
and decided to have tea before he set out  he had tea  at the landladys
suggestion he had a boiled egg with his tea  two shelves in the little
sitting-room were filled with bound volumes of  the strand   in one of
these he found a serial childrens story which he had begun to read as a
child  but abandoned because his tenth birthday came when he was
half-way through it and he was ashamed to read it after that  now  he
chased it from volume to volume till he had finished it  it was good 
the grown-up stories to which  after his tenth birthday  he had turned
instead of it  now seemed to him  except for  sherlock holmes   to be
rubbish  “i suppose i must get on soon ” he said to himself 

his slight reluctance to do so did not proceed from weariness—he felt 
indeed  perfectly rested and better than he had felt for several
weeks—but from a sort of shyness  he was going to see jane  and
denniston  and  probably  the dimbles as well  in fact  he was going to
see jane in what he now felt to be her proper world  but not his  for he
now thought that with all his lifelong eagerness to reach an inner
circle he had chosen the  wrong  circle  jane was where she belonged  he
was going to be admitted only out of kindness  because jane had been
fool enough to marry him  he did not resent it  but he felt shy  he saw
himself as this new circle must see him—as one more little vulgarian 
just like the steeles and the cossers  dull  inconspicuous  frightened 
calculating  cold  he wondered vaguely why he was like that  how did
other people—people like denniston or dimble—find it so easy to saunter
through the world with all their muscles relaxed and a careless eye
roving the horizon  bubbling over with fancy and humour  sensitive to
beauty  not continually on their guard and not needing to be  what was
the secret of that fine  easy laughter which he could not by any efforts
imitate  everything about them was different  they could not even fling
themselves into chairs without suggesting by the very posture of their
limbs a certain lordliness  a leonine indolence  there was elbow-room in
their lives  as there had never been in his  they were hearts  he was
only a spade  still  he must be getting on        of course  jane was a
heart  he must give her her freedom  it would be quite unjust to think
that his love for her had been basely sensual  love  plato says  is the
son of want  marks body knew better than his mind had known till
recently  and even his sensual desires were the true index of something
which he lacked and jane had to give  when she had first crossed the dry
and dusty world which his mind inhabited she had been like a spring
shower  in opening himself to it he had not been mistaken  he had gone
wrong only in assuming that marriage  by itself  gave him either power
or title to appropriate that freshness  as he now saw  one might as well
have thought one could buy a sunset by buying the field from which one
had seen it 

he rang the bell and asked for his bill 


                                   ii

that same afternoon mother dimble and the three girls were upstairs in
the big room which occupied nearly the whole top floor of one wing at
the manor  and which the director called the wardrobe  if you had
glanced in you would have thought for one moment that they were not in a
room at all but in some kind of forest—a tropical forest glowing with
bright colours  a second glance and you might have thought they were in
one of those delightful upper rooms at a big shop where carpets standing
on end and rich stuffs hanging from the roof make a kind of woven forest
of their own  in fact  they were standing amidst a collection of robes
of state—dozens of robes which hung  each separate  from its little
pillar of wood 

“that would do beautifully for you  ivy ” said mother dimble  lifting
with one hand the fold of a vividly green mantle over which thin twists
and spirals of gold played in a festive pattern  “come  ivy ” she
continued  “dont you like it  youre not still fretting about tom  are
you  hasnt the director told you hell be here to-night or to-morrow
midday at the latest ”

ivy looked at her with troubled eyes 

“tisnt that ” she said  “wherell the director himself be ”

“but you cant want him to stay  ivy ” said camilla  “not in continual
pain  and his work will be done—if all goes well at edgestow ”

“he has longed to go back to perelandra ” said mother dimble  “hes—sort
of home-sick  always  always       i could see it in his eyes ”

“will that merling man come back here ” asked ivy 

“i dont think so ” said jane  “i dont think either he or the director
expected him to  and then my dream last night  it looked as if he was on
fire       i dont mean burning  you know  but light—all sorts of lights
in the most curious colours shooting out of him and running up and down
him  that was the last thing i saw  merlin standing there like a kind of
pillar and all those dreadful things happening all round him  and you
could see in his face that he was a man used up to the last drop  if you
know what i mean—that hed fall to pieces the moment the powers let him
go ”

“were not getting on with choosing our dresses for to-night ”

“what is it made of ” said camilla  fingering and then smelling the
green mantle  it was a question worth asking  it was not in the least
transparent  yet all sorts of lights and shades dwelled in its rippling
folds  and it flowed through camillas hands like a waterfall  ivy
became interested 

“gor ” she said  “however much a yard would it be ”

“there ” said mother dimble as she draped it skilfully round ivy  then
she said “oh ” in genuine amazement  all three stood back from ivy 
staring at her with delight  the commonplace had not exactly gone from
her form and face  the robe had taken it up  as a great composer takes
up a folk-tune and tosses it like a ball through his symphony and makes
of it a marvel  yet leaves it still itself  a “pert fairy” or “dapper
elf ” a small though perfect sprightliness  stood before them  but still
recognisably ivy maggs 

“isnt that like a man ” exclaimed mrs  dimble  “theres not a mirror in
the room ”

“i dont believe we were meant to see ourselves ” said jane  “he said
something about being mirrors enough to one another ”

“i would just like to see what im like at the back ” said ivy 

“now  camilla ” said mother dimble  “theres no puzzle about you  this
is obviously your one ”

“oh  do you think  that  one ” said camilla 

“yes  of course ” said jane 

“youll look ever so nice in that ” said ivy 

it was a long slender thing which looked like steel in colour  though it
was soft as foam to the touch  it wrapped itself close about her loins
and flowed out in a glancing train at her heels  “like a mermaid ”
thought jane  and then “like a valkyrie ”

“im afraid ” said mother dimble  “you must wear a coronet with that
one ”

“wouldnt that be rather        ”

but mother dimble was already setting it on her head  that reverence  it
need have nothing to do with money value  which nearly all women feel
for jewellery hushed three of them for a moment  there were  perhaps  no
such diamonds in england  the splendour was fabulous  preposterous 

“what are you all staring at ” asked camilla  who had seen but one flash
as the crown was raised in mrs  dimbles hands and did not know that she
stood “like starlight  in the spoils of provinces ”

“are they real ” said ivy 

“where did they come from  mother dimble ” asked jane 

“treasure of logres  dears  treasure of logres ” said mrs  dimble 
“perhaps from beyond the moon or before the flood  now  jane ”

jane could see nothing specially appropriate in the robe which the
others agreed in putting on her  blue was  indeed  her colour  but she
thought of something a little more austere and dignified  left to her
own judgement  she would have called this a little “fussy ” but when she
saw the others all clap their hands  she submitted  indeed  it did not
now occur to her to do otherwise  and the whole matter was forgotten a
moment later in the excitement of choosing a robe for mother dimble 

“something quiet ” she said  “im an old woman and i dont want to be
ridiculous ”

“this wouldnt do at all ” said camilla  walking down the long row of
hanging splendours  herself like a meteor as she passed against that
background of purple and gold and scarlet and soft snow and elusive
opal  of fur  silk  velvet  taffeta  and brocade  “thats lovely ” she
said  “but not for you  and oh —look at that  but it wouldnt do  i
dont see anything      ”

“here  oh  do come and look  come here ” cried ivy  as if she were
afraid her discovery would run away unless the others attended to it
quickly 

“oh  yes  yes  indeed ” said jane 

“certainly ” said camilla 

“put it on  mother dimble ” said ivy  “you know you got to ” it was of
that almost tyrannous flame colour which jane had seen in her vision
down in the lodge  but differently cut  with fur about the great copper
brooch that clasped the throat  with long sleeves and hangings from
them  and there went with it a many-cornered cap  and they had no sooner
clasped the robe than all were astonished  none more than jane  though
indeed she had had best reason to foresee the result  for now this
provincial wife of a rather obscure scholar  this respectable and barren
woman with grey hair and double chin  stood before her  not to be
mistaken  as a kind of priestess or sybil  the servant of some
prehistoric goddess of fertility—an old tribal matriarch  mother of
mothers  grave  formidable  and august  a long staff  curiously carved
as if a snake twined up it  was apparently part of the costume  they put
it in her hand 

“am i awful ” said mother dimble  looking in turn at the three silent
faces 

“you look lovely ” said ivy 

“it is exactly right ” said camilla 

jane took up the old ladys hand and kissed it  “darling ” she said 
“ aweful   in the old sense  is just what you  do  look ”

“what are the men going to wear ” asked camilla suddenly 

“ they  cant very well go in fancy dress  can they ” said ivy  “not if
theyre cooking and bringing things in and out all the time  and i must
say if this is to be the last night and all i do think we ought to have
done the dinner  anyway  let them do as they like about the wine  and
what theyll do with that goose is more than i like to think  because i
dont believe that mr  macphee ever roasted a bird in his life  whatever
he says ”

“they cant spoil the oysters  anyway ” said camilla 

“thats right ” said ivy  “nor the plum pudding  not really  still  id
like just to go down and take a look ”

“youd better not ” said jane with a laugh  “you know what hes like
when hes in charge in the kitchen ”

“im not afraid of  him  ” said ivy  almost  but not quite  putting out
her tongue  and in her present dress the gesture was not uncomely 

“you neednt be in the least worried about the dinner  girls ” said
mother dimble  “he will do it very well  always provided he and my
husband dont get into a philosophical argument just when they ought to
be dishing up  lets go and enjoy ourselves  how very warm it is in
here ”

“s lovely ” said ivy 

at that moment the whole room shook from end to end 

“what on earths that ” said jane 

“if the war was still on id have said it was a bomb ” said ivy 

“come and look ” said camilla  who had regained her composure sooner
than any of the others and was now at the window which looked west
towards the valley of the wynd  “oh  look ” she said again  “no  its
not fire  and its not searchlights  and its not forked lightning  ugh 
      theres another shock  and there       look at that  its as
bright as day there beyond the church  what am i talking about  its
only three oclock  its brighter than day  and the heat ”

“it has begun ” said mother dimble 


                                  iii

at about the same time that morning when mark had climbed into the
lorry  feverstone  not much hurt but a good deal shaken  climbed out of
the stolen car  that car had ended its course upside down in a deep
ditch  and feverstone  always ready to look on the bright side 
reflected as he extricated himself that things might have been worse—it
might have been his own car  the snow was deep in the ditch and he was
very wet  as he stood up and looked about him he saw that he was not
alone  a tall and massive figure in a black cassock was before him 
about five yards distant  its back was towards him  and it was already
walking steadily away  “hi ” shouted feverstone  the other turned and
looked at him in silence for a second or two  then it resumed its walk 
feverstone felt at once that this was not the sort of man he would get
on with—in fact he had never liked the look of anyone less  nor could
he  in his broken and soaking pumps  follow the four-mile-an-hour stride
of those booted feet  he did not attempt it  the black figure came to a
gate  there stopped and made a whinnying noise  he was apparently
talking to a horse across the gate  next moment  feverstone did not
quite see how it happened  the man was over the gate and on the horses
back and off at a canter across a wide field that rose milk-white to the
sky-line 

feverstone had no idea where he was  but clearly the first thing to do
was to reach a road  it took him much longer than he expected  it was
not freezing now and deep puddles lay hidden beneath the snow in many
places  at the bottom of the first hill he came to such a morass that he
was driven to abandon the track of the roman road and try striking
across the fields  the decision was fatal  it kept him for two hours
looking for gaps in hedges and trying to reach things that looked like
roads from a distance but turned out to be nothing of the sort when one
reached them  he had always hated the country and always hated weather 
and he was not at any time fond of walking 

near twelve oclock he found a road with no signposts that led him an
hour later into a main road  here  thank heavens  there was a fair
amount of traffic  both cars and pedestrians  all going one way  the
first three cars took no notice of his signals  the fourth stopped 
“quick  in you get ” said the driver 

“going to edgestow ” asked feverstone  his hand on the door 

“good lord  no ” said the other  “ theres  edgestow ”  and he pointed
behind him —“if you want to go  there  ” the man seemed surprised and
considerably excited 

in the end there was nothing for it but walking  every vehicle was going
away from edgestow  none going towards it  feverstone was a little
surprised  he knew all about the exodus  indeed  it had been part of his
plan to clear the city as far as possible   but he had supposed it would
be over by now  but all that afternoon as he splashed and slipped
through the churned snow  the fugitives were still passing him  we have 
naturally  hardly any first-hand evidence for what happened in edgestow
that afternoon and evening  but we have plenty of stories as to how so
many people came to leave it at the last moment  they filled the papers
for weeks and lingered in private talks for months  and in the end
became a joke  “no  i  dont  want to hear how you got out of edgestow”
came to be a catch phrase  but behind all the exaggerations there
remains the undoubted truth that a quite astonishing number of citizens
left the town just in time  one had had a message from a dying father 
another had decided quite suddenly  and he couldnt just say why  to go
and take a little holiday  another went because the pipes in his house
had been burst by the frost and he thought he might as well go away till
they were put right  not a few had gone because of some trivial event
which seemed to them an omen—a dream  a broken looking-glass  tea-leaves
in a cup  omens of a more ancient kind had also revived during this
crisis  one had heard his donkey  another her cat  say “as clear as
clear ” “ go away  ” and hundreds were still leaving for the old
reason—because their houses had been taken from them  their livelihood
destroyed  and their liberties threatened by the institutional police 

it was at about four oclock that feverstone found himself flung on his
face  that was the first shock  they continued  increasing in frequency 
during the hours that followed—horrible shudderings  and soon heavings 
of the earth  and a growing murmur of widespread subterranean noise  the
temperature began to rise  snow was disappearing in every direction and
at times he was knee-deep in water  haze from the melting snow filled
the air  when he reached the brow of the last steep descent into
edgestow he could see nothing of the city  only fog through which
extraordinary coruscations of light came up to him  another shock sent
him sprawling  he now decided not to go down  he would turn and follow
the traffic—work over to the railway line and try to get to london  the
picture of a steaming bath at his club  of himself on the fender of the
smoking-room telling this whole story  rose in his mind  it would be
something to have survived both belbury and bracton  he had survived a
good many things in his day and believed in his luck 

he was already a few paces down the hill when he made this decision  and
he turned at once  but instead of going up he found he was still
descending  as if he were in shale on a mountain slope  instead of on a
metalled road  the ground slipped away backwards where he trod on it 
when he arrested his descent he was thirty yards lower  he began again 
this time he was flung off his feet  rolled head over heels  stones 
earth  grass  and water pouring over him and round him in riotous
confusion  it was as when a great wave overtakes you while you are
bathing  but this time it was an earth wave  he got to his feet once
again  set his face to the hill  behind him the valley seemed to have
turned into hell  the pit of fog had been ignited and burned with
blinding violet flame  water was roaring somewhere  buildings crashing 
mobs shouting  the hill in front of him was in ruins—no trace of road 
hedge  or field  only a cataract of loose raw earth  it was also far
steeper than it had been  his mouth and hair and nostrils were full of
earth  the slope was growing steeper as he looked at it  the ridge
heaved up and up  then the whole wave of earth rose  arched  trembled 
and with all its weight and noise poured down on him 


                                   iv

“why logres  sir ” said camilla 

dinner was over at st  annes and they sat at their wine in a circle
about the dining-room fire  as mrs  dimble had prophesied  the men had
cooked it very well  only after their serving was over and the board
cleared had they put on their festal garments  now all sat at their ease
and all diversely splendid  ransom crowned  at the right of the hearth 
grace ironwood in black and silver opposite him  it was so warm that
they had let the fire burn low  and in the candlelight the court dresses
seemed to glow of themselves 

“tell them  dimble ” said ransom  “i will not talk much from now on ”

“are you tired  sir ” said grace  “is the pain bad ”

“no  grace ” he replied  “it isnt that  but now that its so very
nearly time for me to go  all this begins to feel like a dream  a happy
dream  you understand  all of it  even the pain  i want to taste every
drop  i feel as though it would be dissolved if i talked much ”

“i suppose you  got  to go  sir ” said ivy 

“my dear ” said he  “what else is there to do  i have not grown a day or
an hour older since i came back from perelandra  there is no natural
death to look forward to  the wound will only be healed in the world
where it was got ”

“all this has the disadvantage of being clean contrary to the observed
laws of nature ” observed macphee  the director smiled without speaking 
as a man who refuses to be drawn 

“it is not contrary to the laws of nature ” said a voice from the corner
where grace ironwood sat  almost invisible in the shadows  “you are
quite right  the laws of the universe are never broken  your mistake is
to think that the little regularities we have observed on one planet for
a few hundred years are the real unbreakable laws  whereas they are only
the remote results which the true laws bring about more often than not 
as a kind of accident ”

“shakespeare never breaks the real laws of poetry ” put in dimble  “but
by following them he breaks every now and then the little regularities
which critics mistake for the real laws  then the little critics call it
a licence  but theres nothing licentious about it to shakespeare ”

“and that ” said denniston  “is why nothing in nature is  quite 
regular  there are always exceptions  a good average uniformity  but not
complete ”

“not many exceptions to the law of death have come my way ” observed
macphee 

“and  how  ” said grace with much emphasis  “how should  you  expect to
be there on more than one such occasion  were you a friend of arthurs
or barbarossas  did you know enoch or elijah ”

“do you mean ” said jane  “that the director       the pendragon      
is going where they went ”

“he will be with arthur  certainly ” said dimble  “i cant answer for
the rest  there are people who have never died  we do not yet know why 
we know a little more than we did about the how  there are many places
in the universe—i mean  this same physical universe in which our planet
moves—where an organism can last practically for ever  where arthur is 
we know ”

“where ” said camilla 

“in the third heaven  in perelandra  in aphallin  the distant island
which the descendants of tor and tinidril will not find for a hundred
centuries  perhaps alone ”       he hesitated and looked at ransom  who
shook his head 

“and that is where logres comes in  is it ” said camilla  “because he
will be with arthur ”

dimble was silent for a few minutes  arranging and rearranging the
fruit-knife and fruit-fork on his plate 

“it all began ” he said  ”when we discovered that the arthurian story is
mostly true history  there was a moment in the sixth century when
something that is always trying to break through into this country
nearly succeeded  logres was our name for it—it will do as well as
another  and then       gradually we began to see all english history in
a new way  we discovered the haunting ”

“what haunting ” asked camilla 

“how something we may call britain is always haunted by something we may
call logres  havent you noticed that we are two countries  after every
arthur  a mordred  behind every milton  a cromwell  a nation of poets  a
nation of shopkeepers  the home of sidney—and of cecil rhodes  is it any
wonder they call us hypocrites  but what they mistake for hypocrisy is
really the struggle between logres and britain ”

he paused and took a sip of wine before proceeding 

“it was long afterwards ” he said  “after the director had returned from
the third heaven  that we were told a little more  this haunting turned
out to be not only from the other side of the invisible wall  ransom was
summoned to the bedside of an old man then dying in cumberland  his name
would mean nothing to you if i told it  that man was the pendragon  the
successor of arthur and uther and cassibelaun  then we learned the
truth  there has been a secret logres in the very heart of britain all
these years  an unbroken succession of pendragons  that old man was the
seventy-eighth from arthur  our director received from him the office
and the blessing  to-morrow we shall know  or to-night  who is to be the
eightieth  some of the pendragons are well known to history  though not
under that name  others you have never heard of  but in every age they
and the little logres which gathered round them have been the fingers
which gave the tiny shove or the almost imperceptible pull  to prod
england out of the drunken sleep or to draw her back from the final
outrage into which britain tempted her ”

“this new history of yours ” said macphee  “is a wee bit lacking in
documents ”

“it has plenty ” said dimble with a smile  “but you do not know the
language theyre written in  when the history of these last few months
comes to be written in  your  language  and printed  and taught in
schools  there will be no mention in it of you and me  nor of merlin and
the pendragon and the planets  and yet in these months britain rebelled
most dangerously against logres and was defeated only just in time ”

“aye ” said macphee  “and it could be right good history without
mentioning you and me or most of those present  id be greatly obliged
if anyone would tell me what we  have  done—always apart from feeding
the pigs and raising some very decent vegetables ”

“you have done what was required of you ” said the director  “you have
obeyed and waited  it will often happen like that  as one of the modern
authors has told us  the altar must often be built in one place in order
that the fire from heaven may descend somewhere else  but dont jump to
conclusions  you may have plenty of work to do before a month is passed 
britain has lost a battle  but she will rise again ”

“so that  meanwhile  is england ” said mother dimble  “just this swaying
to and fro between logres and britain ”

“yes ” said her husband  “dont you feel it  the very quality of
england  if weve got an asss head it is by walking in a fairy wood 
weve heard something better than we can do  but cant quite forget it
      cant you see it in everything english—a kind of awkward grace  a
humble  humorous incompleteness  how right sam weller was when he called
mr  pickwick an angel in gaiters  everything here is either better or
worse than——”

“dimble ” said ransom  dimble  whose tone had become a little
impassioned  stopped and looked towards him  he hesitated and  as jane
thought  almost blushed before he began again 

“youre right  sir ” he said with a smile  “i was forgetting what you
have warned me always to remember  this haunting is no peculiarity of
ours  every people has its own haunter  theres no special privilege for
england—no nonsense about a chosen nation  we speak about logres because
it is  our  haunting  the one we know about ”

“all this ” said macphee  “seems a very roundabout way of saying that
theres good and bad men everywhere ”

“its not a way of saying that at all ” answered dimble  “you see 
macphee  if one is thinking simply of goodness in the abstract  one soon
reaches the fatal idea of something standardised—some common kind of
life to which all nations ought to progress  of course there are
universal rules to which all goodness must conform  but thats only the
grammar of virtue  its not there that the sap is  he doesnt make two
blades of grass the same  how much less two saints  two nations  two
angels  the whole work of healing tellus depends on nursing that little
spark  on incarnating that ghost  which is still alive in every real
people  and different in each  when logres really dominates britain 
when the goddess reason  the divine clearness  is really enthroned in
france  when the order of heaven is really followed in china—why  then
it will be spring  but meantime  our concern is with logres  weve got
britain down but who knows how long we can hold her down  edgestow will
not recover from what is happening to her to-night  but there will be
other edgestows ”

“i wanted to ask about edgestow ” said mother dimble  “arent merlin and
the eldils a trifle       well   wholesale   did  all  edgestow deserve
to be wiped out ”

“who are you lamenting ” said macphee  “the jobbing town council thatd
have sold their own wives and daughters to bring the n i c e  to
edgestow ”

“well  i dont know much about them ” said she  “but in the university 
even bracton itself  we all knew it was a horrible college  of course 
but did they really mean any great harm with all their fussy little
intrigues  wasnt it more  silly  than anything else ”

“och aye ” said macphee  “they were only playing themselves  kittens
letting on to be tigers  but there was a real tiger about and their play
ended by letting her in  theyve no call to complain if  when the
hunters after her  he lets them have a bit of a lead in their guts 
too  itll learn them not to keep bad company ”

“well  then  the fellows of other colleges  what about northumberland
and dukes ”

“i know ” said denniston  “ones sorry for a man like churchwood  i knew
him well  he was an old dear  all his lectures were devoted to proving
the impossibility of ethics  though in private life hed have walked ten
miles rather than leave a penny debt unpaid  but all the same       was
there a single doctrine practised at belbury which hadnt been preached
by some lecturer at edgestow  oh  of course  they never thought anyone
would  act  on their theories  no one was more astonished than they when
what theyd been talking of for years suddenly took on reality  but it
was their own child coming back to them  grown up and unrecognisable 
but their own ”

“im afraid its all true  my dear ” said dimble  “ trahison des
clercs   none of us are quite innocent ”

“thats nonsense  cecil ” said mrs  dimble 

“you are all forgetting ” said grace  “that nearly everyone except the
very good  who were ripe for fair dismissal  and the very bad  had
already left edgestow  but i agree with arthur  those who have forgotten
logres sink into britain  those who call for nonsense will find that it
comes ”

at that moment she was interrupted  a clawing and whining noise at the
door had become audible 

“open the door  arthur ” said ransom  a moment later the whole party
rose to its feet with cries of welcome  for the new arrival was mr 
bultitude 

“oh  i never  did  ” said ivy  “the pore thing  and all over snow  too 
ill just take him down to the kitchen and get him something to eat 
wherever have you been  you bad thing  eh  just look at the state youre
in ”


                                   v

for the third time in ten minutes the train gave a violent lurch and
came to a standstill  this time the shock put all the lights out 

“this is really getting a bit too bad ” said a voice in the darkness 
the four other passengers in the first-class compartment recognised it
as belonging to the well-bred  bulky man in the brown suit  the
well-informed man who at earlier stages of the journey had told everyone
else where they ought to change and why one now reached sterk without
going through stratford and who it was that really controlled the line 

“its serious for me ” said the same voice  “i ought to be in edgestow
by now ” he got up  opened the window  and stared out into the darkness 
presently one of the other passengers complained of the cold  he shut
the window and sat down 

“weve already been here for ten minutes ” he said presently 

“excuse me  twelve ” said another passenger 

still the train did not move  the noise of two men quarrelling in a
neighbouring compartment became audible 

suddenly a shock flung them all together in the darkness  it was as if
the train  going at full speed  had been unskilfully pulled up 

“what the devils that ” said one 

“open the doors ”

“has there been a collision ”

“its all right ” said the well-informed man in a loud  calm voice 
“putting on another engine  and doing it very badly  its all these new
engine-drivers theyve got in lately ”

“hullo ” said someone  “were moving ”

slow and grunting  the train began to go 

“it takes its time getting up speed ” said someone 

“oh  youll find itll start making up for lost time in a minute ” said
the well-informed man 

“i wish theyd put the lights on again ” said a womans voice 

“were  not  getting up speed ” said another 

“were losing it  damn it  are we stopping again ”

“no  were still moving—oh  ”—once more a violent shock hit them  it was
worse than the last one  for nearly a minute everything seemed to be
rocking and rattling 

“this is outrageous ” exclaimed the well-informed man  once more opening
the window  this time he was more fortunate  a dark figure waving a
lantern was walking past beneath him 

“hi  porter  guard ” he bellowed 

“its all right  ladies and gentlemen  its all right  keep your seats ”
shouted the dark figure  marching past and ignoring him 

“theres no good letting all that cold air in  sir ” said the passenger
next the window 

“theres some sort of light ahead ” said the well-informed man 

“signal against us ” asked another 

“no  not a bit like that  the whole skys lit up  like a fire  or like
searchlights ”

“i dont care what its like ” said the chilly man  “if only—oh ”

another shock  and then  far away in the darkness  vague disastrous
noise  the train began to move again  still slowly  as if it were
groping its way 

“ill make a row about this ” said the well-informed man  “its a
scandal ”

about half an hour later the lighted platform of sterk slowly loomed
alongside 

“station announcer calling ” said a voice  “please keep your seats for
an important announcement  slight earthquake shock and floods have
rendered the line to edgestow impassable  no details available 
passengers for edgestow are advised      ”

the well-informed man  who was curry  got out  such a man always knows
all the officials on a railway  and in a few minutes he was standing by
the fire in the ticket-collectors office getting a further and private
report of the disaster 

“well  we dont exactly know yet  mr  curry ” said the man  “theres
been nothing coming through for about an hour  its very bad  you know 
theyre putting the best face on it they can  theres never been an
earthquake like it in england from what i can hear  and theres the
floods  too  no  sir  im afraid youll find nothing of bracton college 
all that part of the town went almost at once  it began there  i
understand  i dont know what the casualtiesll be  im glad i got my
old dad out last week ”

curry always in later years regarded this as one of the turning-points
of his life  he had not up till then been a religious man  but the word
that now instantly came into his mind was “providential ” you couldnt
really look at it any other way  hed been within an ace of taking the
earlier train  and if he had       why  hed have been a dead man by
now  it made one think  the whole college wiped out  it would have to be
rebuilt  thered be a complete  or almost complete  new set of fellows 
a new warden  it was providential again that some responsible person
should have been spared to deal with such a tremendous crisis  there
couldnt be an ordinary election  of course  the college visitor  who
was the lord chancellor  would probably have to appoint a new warden and
then  in collaboration with him  a nucleus of new fellows  the more he
thought of it  the more fully curry realised that the whole shaping of
the future college rested with the sole survivor  it was almost like
being a second founder  providential—providential  he saw already in
imagination the portrait of that second founder in the new-built hall 
his statue in the new-built quadrangle  the long  long chapter
consecrated to him in the college history  all this time  and without
the least hypocrisy  habit and instinct had given his shoulders just
such a droop  his eyes such a solemn sternness  his brow such a noble
gravity  as a man of good feeling might be expected to exhibit on
hearing such news  the ticket-collector was greatly edified  “you could
see he felt it bad ” as he said afterwards  “but he could take it  hes
a fine old chap ”

“when is the next train to london ” asked curry  “i must be in town
first thing to-morrow morning ”


                                   vi

ivy maggs  it will be remembered  had left the dining-room for the
purpose of attending to mr  bultitudes comfort  it therefore surprised
everyone when she returned in less than a minute with a wild expression
on her face 

“oh  come quick  someone  come quick ” she gasped  “theres a bear in
the kitchen ”

“a bear  ivy ” said the director  “but of course——”

“oh  i dont mean mr  bultitude  sir  theres a strange bear  another
one ”

“indeed ”

“and its eaten up all what was left of the goose and half the ham and
all the junket  and now its lying along the table eating everything as
it goes along and wriggling from one dish to another and a-breaking all
the crockery  oh  do come quick  therell be nothing left ”

“and what line is mr  bultitude taking about all this  ivy ” asked
ransom 

“well  thats what i want someone to come and see  hes carrying on
something dreadful  sir  i never see anything like it  first of all he
just stood lifting up his legs in a funny way as if he thought he could
dance  which we all know he cant  but now hes got up on the dresser on
his hind legs and there hes kind of bobbing up and down  making the
awfullest noise—squeaking like—and hes put one foot into the plum
pudding already and hes got his head all mixed up in the string of
onions and i cant do  nothing  with him  really i cant ”

“this is very odd behaviour for mr  bultitude  you dont think  my dear 
that the stranger might be a  she  bear ”

“oh  dont say that  sir ” exclaimed ivy with extreme dismay 

“i think thats the truth  ivy  i strongly suspect that this is the
future mrs  bultitude ”

“itll be the present mrs  bultitude if we sit here talking about it
much longer ” said macphee  rising to his feet 

“oh dear  what  shall  we do ” said ivy 

“i am sure mr  bultitude is quite equal to the situation ” replied the
director  “at present the lady is refreshing herself   sine cerere et
baccho   dimble  we can trust them to manage their own affairs ”

“no doubt  no doubt ” said macphee  “but not in our kitchen ”

“ivy  my dear ” said ransom  “you must be very firm  go into the kitchen
and tell the strange bear i want to see her  you wouldnt be afraid 
would you ”

“afraid  not me  ill show her whos the director here  not that it
isnt only natural for her ”

“whats the matter with that jackdaw ” said dr  dimble 

“i think its trying to get out ” said denniston  “shall i open the
window ”

“its warm enough to have the window open  anyway ” said the director 
and as the window was opened baron corvo hopped out and there was a
scuffle and a chattering just outside 

“another love affair ” said mrs  dimble  “it sounds as if jack had found
a jill        what a delicious night ” she added  for as the curtain
swelled and lifted over the open window  all the freshness of a
midsummer night seemed to be blowing into the room  at that moment  a
little farther off  came a sound of whinnying 

“hullo ” said denniston  “the old mare is excited  too ”

“sh  listen ” said jane 

“thats a different horse ” said denniston 

“its a stallion ” said camilla 

“this ” said macphee with great emphasis  “is becoming indecent ”

“on the contrary ” said ransom  “decent  in the old sense   decens  
fitting  is just what she is  venus herself is over st  annes ”

“she comes more near the earth than she was wont ” quoted dimble  “to
make men mad ”

“she is nearer than any astronomer knows ” said ransom  “the work at
edgestow is done  the other gods have withdrawn  she waits still  and
when she returns to her sphere i will ride with her ”

suddenly in the semi-darkness mrs  dimbles voice cried sharply  “look
out  look out  cecil  im sorry  i cant stand bats  theyll get in my
hair ”  cheep cheep  went the voices of the two bats as they flickered
to and fro above the candles  because of their shadows they seemed to be
four bats instead of two 

“youd better go  margaret ” said the director  “you and cecil had
better both go  i shall be gone very soon now  there is no need of long
good-byes ”

“i really think i  must  go ” said mother dimble  “i cant stand bats ”

“comfort margaret  cecil ” said ransom  “no  do not stay  im not dying 
seeing people off is always folly  its neither good mirth nor good
sorrow ”

“you mean us to go  sir ” said dimble 

“go  my dear friends   urendi maleldil  ”

he laid his hands on their heads  cecil gave his arm to his wife and
they went 

“here she is  sir ” said ivy maggs  re-entering the room a moment later 
flushed and radiant  a bear waddled at her side  its muzzle white with
junket and its cheeks sticky with gooseberry jam  “and—oh  sir ” she
added 

“what is it  ivy ” said the director 

“please  sir  its poor tom  its my husband  and if you dont mind——”

“youve given him something to eat and drink  i hope ”

“well  yes  i have  there wouldnt have been nothing if those bears had
been there much longer ”

“what has tom got  ivy ”

“i give him the cold pie and the pickles  he always was a great one for
pickles  and the end of the cheese and a bottle of stout  and ive put
the kettle on so as we can make ourselves—so as he can make himself a
nice cup of tea  and hes enjoying it ever so  sir  and he said would
you mind him not coming up to say how dyou do because he never was much
of a one for company if you take my meaning ”

all this time the strange bear had been standing perfectly still with
its eyes fixed on the director  now he laid his hand on its flat head 
“ urendi maleldil  ” he said  “you are a good bear  go to your mate—but
here he is ” for at that moment the door  which was already a little
ajar  was pushed further open to admit the enquiring and slightly
anxious face of mr  bultitude  “take her  bultitude  but not in the
house  jane  open the other window  the french window  it is like a
night in july ” the window swung open and the two bears went blundering
out into the warmth and the wetness  everyone noticed how light it had
become 

“are those birds all daft that theyre singing at quarter to twelve ”
asked macphee 

“no ” said ransom  “they are sane  now  ivy  you want to go and talk to
tom  mother dimble has put you both in the little room half-way up the
stairs  not in the lodge  after all ”

“oh  sir ” said ivy  and stopped  the director leaned forward and laid
his hand on her head  “of course you want to go ” he said  “why  hes
hardly had time to see you in your new dress yet  have you no kisses to
give him ” he said  and kissed her  “then give him mine  which are not
mine but by derivation  dont cry  you are a good woman  go and heal
this man   urendi maleldil —we shall meet again ”

“whats all yon squealing and squeaking ” said macphee  “i hope its not
the pigs got loose  for i tell you theres already as much carrying on
about this house and garden as i can stand ”

“i think its hedgehogs ” said grace ironwood 

“that last sound was somewhere in the house ” said jane 

“listen ” said the director  and for a short time all were still  then
his face relaxed into a smile  “its my friends behind the wainscot ” he
said  “there are revels there  too—

  “ so geht es in snützepützhaüsel 
   da singen und tanzen die maüsel  ”

“i suppose ” said macphee drily  producing his snuff-box from under the
ash-coloured and slightly monastic-looking robe in which  contrary to
his own judgement  the others had seen fit to clothe him  “i suppose we
may think ourselves lucky that no giraffes  hippopotami  elephants  or
the like have seen fit to—god almighty  whats that ” for as he spoke  a
long grey flexible tube came in between the swaying curtains and 
passing over macphees shoulder  helped itself to a bunch of bananas 

“in the name of hell  wheres all them beasts coming from ” he said 

“they are the liberated prisoners from belbury ” said the director  “she
comes more near the earth than she was wont to—to make earth sane 
perelandra is all about us and man is no longer isolated  we are now as
we ought to be—between the angels who are our elder brothers and the
beasts who are our jesters  servants  and playfellows ”

whatever macphee was attempting to say in reply was drowned by an
ear-splitting noise from beyond the window 

“elephants  two of them ” said jane weakly  “oh  the celery  and the
rose beds ”

“by your leave  mr  director ” said macphee sternly  “ill just draw
these curtains  you seem to forget there are ladies present ”

“no ” said grace ironwood in a voice as strong as his  “there will be
nothing unfit for anyone to see  draw them wider  how light it is 
brighter than moonlight  almost brighter than day  a great dome of light
stands over the whole garden  look  the elephants are dancing  how high
they lift their feet  and they go round and round  and oh  look —how
they lift their trunks  and how ceremonial they are  it is like a minuet
of giants  they are not like the other animals  they are a sort of good
daemons ”

“they are moving away ” said camilla 

“they will be as private as human lovers ” said the director  “they are
not common beasts ”

“i think ” said macphee  “ill away down to my office and cast some
accounts  id feel easier in my mind if i were inside and the door
locked before any crocodiles or kangaroos start courting in the middle
of all my files  thered better be one man about the place keep his head
this night  for the rest of you are clean daft  good night  ladies ”

“good-bye  macphee ” said ransom 

“no  no ” said macphee  standing well back but extending his hand 
“youll speak none of your blessings over me  if ever i take to
religion  it wont be your kind  my uncle was moderator of the general
assembly  but theres my hand  what you and i have seen together      
but no matter for that  and ill say this  dr  ransom  that with all
your faults  and theres no man alive knows them better than myself  you
are the best man  taking you by and large  that ever i knew or heard of 
you are       you and i       but there are the ladies crying  i dont
rightly know what i was going to say  im away this minute  why would a
man want to lengthen it  god bless you  dr  ransom  ladies  ill wish
you a good night ”

“open all the windows ” said ransom  “the vessel in which i must ride is
now almost within the air of this world ”

“it is growing brighter every minute ” said denniston 

“can we be with you to the very end ” said jane 

“child ” said the director  “you should not stay till then ”

“why  sir ”

“you are waited for ”

“me  sir ”

“yes  your husband is waiting for you in the lodge  it was your own
marriage chamber that you prepared  should you not go to him ”

“must i go  now  ”

“if you leave the decision with me  it is now that i would send you ”

“then i will go  sir  but—but—am i a bear or a hedgehog ”

“more  but not less  go in obedience and you will find love  you will
have no more dreams  have children instead   urendi maleldil  ”

long before he reached st  annes  mark had come to realise that either
he himself or else the world about him was in a very strange condition 
the journey took him longer than he expected  but that was perhaps fully
accounted for by one or two mistakes that he made  much harder to
explain was the horror of light to the west  over edgestow  and the
throbbings and bouncings of the earth  then came the sudden warmth and
the torrents of melted snow rolling down the hillside  everything became
a mist  and then  as the lights in the west vanished  this mist grew
softly luminous in a different place—above him  as though the light
rested on st  annes  and all the time he had the curious impression
that things of very diverse shapes and sizes were slipping past him in
the haze—animals  he thought  perhaps it was all a dream  or perhaps it
was the end of the world  or perhaps he was dead  but in spite of all
perplexities  he was conscious of extreme well-being  his mind was ill
at ease  but as for his body—health and youth and pleasure and longing
seemed to be blowing towards him from the cloudy light upon the hill  he
never doubted that he must keep on 

his mind was not at ease  he knew that he was going to meet jane  and
something was beginning to happen to him which ought to have happened to
him far earlier  that same laboratory outlook upon love which had
forestalled in jane the humility of a wife  had equally forestalled in
him  during what passed for courtship  the humility of a lover  or if
there had ever arisen in him at some wiser moment the sense of “beauty
too rich for use  for earth too dear ” he had put it away from him 
false theories  at once prosaic and fanciful  had made it seem to him a
mood frowsty  unrealistic  and outmoded  now  belated  after all favours
had been conceded  the unexpected misgiving was coming over him  he
tried to shake it off  they were married  werent they  and they were
sensible  modern people  what could be more natural  more ordinary 

but then certain moments of unforgettable failure in their short married
life rose in his imagination  he had thought often enough of what he
called janes “moods ” this time at last he thought of his own clumsy
importunity  and the thought would not go away  inch by inch all the
lout and clown and clod-hopper in him was revealed to his own reluctant
inspection  the coarse  male boor with horny hands and hobnailed shoes
and beefsteak jaw  not rushing in—for that can be carried off—but
blundering  sauntering  stumping in where great lovers  knights and
poets  would have feared to tread  an image of janes skin  so smooth 
so white  or so he now imagined it  that a childs kiss might make a
mark on it  floated before him  how had he dared  her driven snow  her
music  her sacrosanctity  the very style of all her movements       how
had he dared  and dared  too  with no sense of daring  nonchalantly  in
careless stupidity  the very thoughts that crossed her face from moment
to moment  all of them beyond his reach  made  had he but had the wit to
see it  a hedge about her which such as he should never have had the
temerity to pass  yes  yes—of course it was she who had allowed him to
pass it  perhaps in luckless  misunderstanding pity  and he had taken
blackguardly advantage of that noble error in her judgement  had behaved
as if he were native to that fenced garden and even its natural
possessor 

all this  which should have been uneasy joy  was torment to him  for it
came too late  he was discovering the hedge after he had plucked the
rose  and not only plucked it but torn it all to pieces and crumpled it
with hot  thumb-like  greedy fingers  how had he dared  and who that
understood could forgive him  he knew now what he must look like in the
eyes of her friends and equals  seeing that picture  he grew hot to the
forehead  alone there in the mist 

the word  lady  had made no part of his vocabulary save as a pure form 
or else in mockery  he had laughed too soon 

well  he would release her  she would be glad to be rid of him  rightly
glad  it would now almost have shocked him to believe otherwise  ladies
in some noble and spacious room  discoursing in cool ladyhood together 
either with exquisite gravity or with silver laughter—how should they
 not  be glad when the intruder had gone —the loud-voiced or tongue-tied
creature  all boots and hands  whose true place was in the stable  what
should he do in such a room—where his very admiration could only be
insult  his best attempts to be either grave or gay could only reveal
unbridgeable misunderstanding  what he had called her coldness seemed
now to be her patience  whereof the memory scalded  for he loved her
now  but it was all spoiled  too late to mend matters 

suddenly the diffused light brightened and flushed  he looked up and
perceived a great lady standing by a doorway in a wall  it was not jane 
not like jane  it was larger  almost gigantic  it was not human  though
it was like a woman divinely tall  part naked  part wrapped in a
flame-coloured robe  light came from it  the face was enigmatic 
ruthless  he thought  inhumanly beautiful  it was opening the door for
him  he did not dare disobey  “surely ” he thought  “i must have died” 
and he went in  found himself in some place of sweet smells and bright
fires  with food and wine and a rich bed 


                                  viii

and jane went out of the big house with the directors kiss upon her
lips and his words in her ears  into the liquid light and supernatural
warmth of the garden and across the wet lawn  birds were everywhere  and
past the seesaw and the greenhouse and the piggeries  going down all the
time  down to the lodge  descending the ladder of humility  first she
thought of the director  then she thought of maleldil  then she thought
of her obedience and the setting of each foot before the other became a
kind of sacrificial ceremony  and she thought of children  and of pain
and death  and now she was half-way to the lodge  and thought of mark
and of all his sufferings  when she came to the lodge she was surprised
to see it all dark and the door shut  as she stood at the door with one
hand on the latch  a new thought came to her  how if mark did not want
her—not to-night  nor in that way  nor any time  nor in any way  how if
mark were not there  after all  a great gap—of relief or of
disappointment  no one could say—was made in her mind by this thought 
still she did not move the latch  then she noticed that the window  the
bedroom window  was open  clothes were piled on a chair inside the room
so carelessly that they lay over the sill  the sleeve of a shirt—marks
shirt—even hung over down the outside wall  and in all this damp  too 
how exactly like mark  obviously it was high time she went in 


                                the end
